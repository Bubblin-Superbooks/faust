We mark how, ere our times, a sage has thought,  
And then, how far his work, and grandly, we have brought.  

FAUST  

O yes, up to the stars at last!  
Listen, my friend: the ages that are past  
Are now a book with seven seals protected:  
What you the Spirit of the Ages call  
Is nothing but the spirit of you all,  
Wherein the Ages are reflected.  
So, oftentimes, you miserably mar it!  
At the first glance who sees it runs away.  
An offal-barrel and a lumber-garret,  
Or, at the best, a Punch-and-Judy play,  
With maxims most pragmatical and hitting, </pre></div> </div>
