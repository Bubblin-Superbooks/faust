As in the mouths of puppets are befitting!  

WAGNER  

But then, the worldâ€”the human heart and brain!  
Of these one covets some slight apprehension.  

FAUST  

Yes, of the kind which men attain!  
Who dares the child's true name in public mention?  
The few, who thereof something really learned,  
Unwisely frank, with hearts that spurned concealing,  
And to the mob laid bare each thought and feeling,  
Have evermore been crucified and burned.  
I pray you, Friend, 'tis now the dead of night;  
Our converse here must be suspended. </pre></div> </div>
