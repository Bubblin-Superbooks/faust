And, when it finds an angle-worm, rejoices!  

Dare such a human voice disturb the flow,  
Around me here, of spirit-presence fullest?  
And yet, this once my thanks I owe  
To thee, of all earth's sons the poorest, dullest!  
For thou hast torn me from that desperate state  
Which threatened soon to overwhelm my senses:  
The apparition was so giant-great,  
It dwarfed and withered all my soul's pretences!  

I, image of the Godhead, who began—  
Deeming Eternal Truth secure in nearness—  
Ye choirs, have ye begun the sweet, consoling chant,  
Which, through the night of Death, the angels ministrant  
Sang, God's new Covenant repeating? </pre></div> </div>
