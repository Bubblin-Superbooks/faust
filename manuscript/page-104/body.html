CHORUS OF WOMEN  

With spices and precious  
Balm, we arrayed him;  
Faithful and gracious,  
We tenderly laid him:  
Linen to bind him  
Cleanlily wound we:  
Ah! when we would find him,  
Christ no more found we!  

CHORUS OF ANGELS  

Christ is ascended!  
Bliss hath invested him,â€”  
Woes that molested him, </pre></div> </div>
