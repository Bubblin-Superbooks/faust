Now sits exalted?  
Is He, in glow of birth,  
Rapture creative near?  
Ah! to the woe of earth  
Still are we native here.  
We, his aspiring  
Followers, Him we miss;  
Weeping, desiring,  
Master, Thy bliss!

Christ is arisen,  
Out of Corruption's womb:  
Burst ye the prison,  
Break from your gloom!  
Praising and pleading him, </pre></div> </div>
