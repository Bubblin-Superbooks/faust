A FOURTH

Come up to Burgdorf? There you'll find good cheer,  
The finest lasses and the best of beer,  
And jolly rows and squabbles, trust me!

A FIFTH

You swaggering fellow, is your hide  
A third time itching to be tried?  
I won't go there, your jolly rows disgust me!

SERVANT-GIRL

No,â€”no! I'll turn and go to town</pre></div> </div>
