CITIZEN

He suits me not at all, our new-made Burgomaster!  
Since he's installed, his arrogance grows faster.  
How has he helped the town, I say?  
Things worsen,â€”what improvement names he?  
Obedience, more than ever, claims he,  
And more than ever we must pay!

BEGGAR (_sings_)

Good gentlemen and lovely ladies,  
So red of cheek and fine of dress,  
Behold, how needful here your aid is,  
And see and lighten my distress!  
Let me not vainly sing my ditty; </pre></div> </div>
