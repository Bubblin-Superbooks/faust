He's only glad who gives away:  
A holiday, that shows your pity,  
Shall be for me a harvest-day!  

ANOTHER CITIZEN

On Sundays, holidays, there's naught I take delight in,  
Like gossiping of war, and war's array,  
When down in Turkey, far away,  
The foreign people are a-fighting.  
One at the window sits, with glass and friends,  
And sees all sorts of ships go down the river gliding:  
And blesses then, as home he wends  
At night, our times of peace abiding.
