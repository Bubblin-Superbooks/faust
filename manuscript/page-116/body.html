<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">all,<br>The hallowed Original<br>To change to my beloved German.</p><p>(<em>He opens a volume, and commences</em>.)<br>'Tis written: "In the Beginning was the <em>Word</em>."<br>Here am I balked: who, now can help afford?<br>The <em>Word?_â€”impossible so high to rate it;<br>And otherwise must I translate it.<br>If by the Spirit I am truly taught.<br>Then thus: "In the Beginning was the _Thought</em>"  
This first line let me weigh completely,<br>Lest my impatient pen proceed too fleetly.<br>Is it the <em>Thought</em> which works, creates, indeed?<br>"In the Beginning was the <em>Power,"</em> I read.<br>Yet, as I write, a warning is suggested,<br>That I the sense may not have fairly tested.<br>The Spirit aids me: now I see the light!  
"In the Beginning was the <em>Act</em>," I write.</p></div> </div>
