<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>If I must share my chamber with thee,<br>Poodle, stop that howling, prithee!  
Cease to bark and bellow!  
Such a noisy, disturbing fellow<br>I'll no longer suffer near me.<br>One of us, dost hear me!  
Must leave, I fear me.<br>No longer guest-right I bestow;<br>The door is open, art free to go.<br>But what do I see in the creature?<br>Is that in the course of nature?<br>Is't actual fact? or Fancy's shows?<br>How long and broad my poodle grows!  
He rises mightily:<br>A canine form that cannot be!  
What a spectre I've harbored thus!  
He resembles a hippopotamus,<br>With fiery eyes, teeth terrible to see:<br>O, now am I sure of thee!  
For all of thy half-hellish brood<br>The Key of Solomon is good.</p></div> </div>
