Before folks, lest there be misgiving:  
'Tis true, she showed me, on Saint Andrew's Night,  
My future sweetheart, just as he were living.

THE OTHER

She showed me mine, in crystal clear,  
With several wild young blades, a soldier-lover:  
I seek him everywhere, I pry and peer,  
And yet, somehow, his face I can't discover.

SOLDIERS

Castles, with lofty  
Ramparts and towers,  
Maidens disdainful  
In Beauty's array, </pre></div> </div>
