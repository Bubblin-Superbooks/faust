Both shall be ours!  
Bold is the venture,  
Splendid the pay!  
Lads, let the trumpets  
For us be suing,â€”  
Calling to pleasure,  
Calling to ruin.  
Stormy our life is;  
Such is its boon!  
Maidens and castles  
Capitulate soon.  
Bold is the venture,  
Splendid the pay!  
And the soldiers go marching,  
Marching away!
