FAUST

Released from ice are brook and river  
By the quickening glance of the gracious Spring;  
The colors of hope to the valley cling,  
And weak old Winter himself must shiver,  
Withdrawn to the mountains, a crownless king:  
Whence, ever retreating, he sends again  
Impotent showers of sleet that darkle  
In belts across the green o' the plain.  
But the sun will permit no white to sparkle;  
Everywhere form in development moveth;  
He will brighten the world with the tints he loveth,  
And, lacking blossoms, blue, yellow, and red,  
He takes these gaudy people instead.  
Turn thee about, and from this height </pre></div> </div>
