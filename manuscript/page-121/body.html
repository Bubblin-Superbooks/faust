Back on the town direct thy sight.  
Out of the hollow, gloomy gate,  
The motley throngs come forth elate:  
Each will the joy of the sunshine hoard,  
To honor the Day of the Risen Lord!  
They feel, themselves, their resurrection:  
From the low, dark rooms, scarce habitable;  
From the bonds of Work, from Trade's restriction;  
From the pressing weight of roof and gable;  
From the narrow, crushing streets and alleys;  
From the churches' solemn and reverend night,  
All come forth to the cheerful light.  
How lively, see! the multitude sallies,  
Scattering through gardens and fields remote,  
While over the river, that broadly dallies,  
Dances so many a festive boat;  
And overladen, nigh to sinking, </pre></div> </div>
