The last full wherry takes the stream.  
Yonder afar, from the hill-paths blinking,  
Their clothes are colors that softly gleam.  
I hear the noise of the village, even;  
Here is the People's proper Heaven;  
Here high and low contented see!  
Here I am Man,—dare man to be!

WAGNER

To stroll with you, Sir Doctor, flatters;  
'Tis honor, profit, unto me.  
But I, alone, would shun these shallow matters,  
Since all that's coarse provokes my enmity.  
This fiddling, shouting, ten-pin rolling  
I hate,—these noises of the throng:  
They rave, as Satan were their sports controlling. </pre></div> </div>
