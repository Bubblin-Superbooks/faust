The buxom wench, she turned and said:  
"Now, you I call a stupid-head!"  
Hurrah! hurrah!  
Hurrah—tarara-la!  
"Be decent while you're staying!"  

Then round the circle went their flight,  
They danced to left, they danced to right:  
Their kirtles all were playing.  
They first grew red, and then grew warm,  
And rested, panting, arm in arm,—  
Hurrah! hurrah!  
Hurrah—tarara-la!  
And hips and elbows straying.  

Now, don't be so familiar here!  
How many a one has fooled his dear, </pre></div> </div>
