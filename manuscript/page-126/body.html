That not alone your thirst is slake,â€”  
That, as the drops below its brink,  
So many days of life you drink!

FAUST

I take the cup you kindly reach,  
With thanks and health to all and each.

That now our day of joy you share,  
Who heretofore, in evil days,  
Gave us so much of helping care. </pre></div> </div>
