Still many a man stands living here,  
Saved by your father's skillful hand,  
That snatched him from the fever's rage  
And stayed the plague in all the land.  
Then also you, though but a youth,  
Went into every house of pain:  
Many the corpses carried forth,  
But you in health came out again.

FAUST

No test or trial you evaded:  
A Helping God the helper aided.

ALL

Health to the man, so skilled and tried. </pre></div> </div>
