The fiddle stops, the dance delays.  
Thou goest, they stand in rows to see,  
And all the caps are lifted high;  
A little more, and they would bend the knee  
As if the Holy Host came by.

FAUST

A few more steps ascend, as far as yonder stone!â€”  
Here from our wandering will we rest contented.  
Here, lost in thought, I've lingered oft alone,  
When foolish fasts and prayers my life tormented.  
Here, rich in hope and firm in faith,  
With tears, wrung hands and sighs, I've striven,  
The end of that far-spreading death  
Entreating from the Lord of Heaven!  
Now like contempt the crowd's applauses seem: </pre></div> </div>
