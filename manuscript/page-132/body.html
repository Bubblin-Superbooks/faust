The art bequeathed to his possession!  
Dost thou thy father honor, as a youth?

O happy he, who still renews  
The hope, from Error's deeps to rise forever!

Mark how, beneath the evening sunlight's glow,  
The green-embosomed houses glitter!  
The glow retreats, done is the day of toil; </pre></div> </div>
