It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;  
Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil,  
Upon its track to follow, follow soaring!  
Then would I see eternal Evening gild  
The silent world beneath me glowing,  
On fire each mountain-peak, with peace each valley filled,  
The silver brook to golden rivers flowing.  
The mountain-chain, with all its gorges deep,  
Would then no more impede my godlike motion;  
And now before mine eyes expands the ocean  
With all its bays, in shining sleep!  
Yet, finally, the weary god is sinking;  
The new-born impulse fires my mind,â€”  
I hasten on, his beams eternal drinking,  
The Day before me and the Night behind,  
Above me heaven unfurled, the floor of waves beneath</pre></div> </div>
