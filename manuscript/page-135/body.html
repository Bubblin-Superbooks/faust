Nor would I beg the bird his wing to spare us:  
How otherwise the mental raptures bear us  
From page to page, from book to book!  
Then winter nights take loveliness untold,  
As warmer life in every limb had crowned you;  
And when your hands unroll some parchment rare and old,  
All Heaven descends, and opens bright around you!

FAUST

One impulse art thou conscious of, at best;  
O, never seek to know the other!  
Two souls, alas! reside within my breast,  
And each withdraws from, and repels, its brother.  
One with tenacious organs holds in love  
And clinging lust the world in its embraces; </pre></div> </div>
