The other strongly sweeps, this dust above,  
Into the high ancestral spaces.  
If there be airy spirits near,  
'Twixt Heaven and Earth on potent errands fleeing,  
Let them drop down the golden atmosphere,  
And bear me forth to new and varied being!  
Yea, if a magic mantle once were mine,  
To waft me o'er the world at pleasure,  
I would not for the costliest stores of treasure—  
Not for a monarch's robe—the gift resign.

Which through the firmament diffused is faring,  
And danger thousand-fold, our race to wrong.  
In every quarter is preparing. </pre></div> </div>
