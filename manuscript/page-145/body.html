FAUST

(_Entering, with the poodle_.)

Behind me, field and meadow sleeping,  
I leave in deep, prophetic night,  
Within whose dread and holy keeping  
The better soul awakes to light.  
The wild desires no longer win us,  
The deeds of passion cease to chain;  
The love of Man revives within us,  
The love of God revives again.  

Be still, thou poodle; make not such racket and riot! </pre></div> </div>
