Why at the threshold wilt snuffing be?  
Behind the stove repose thee in quiet!  
My softest cushion I give to thee.  
As thou, up yonder, with running and leaping  
Amused us hast, on the mountain's crest,  

So now I take thee into my keeping,  
A welcome, but also a silent, guest.

Ah, when, within our narrow chamber  
The lamp with friendly lustre glows,  
Flames in the breast each faded ember,  
And in the heart, itself that knows.  
Then Hope again lends sweet assistance,  
And Reason then resumes her speech:  
One yearns, the rivers of existence,  
The very founts of Life, to reach. </pre></div> </div>
