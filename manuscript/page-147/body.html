Snarl not, poodle! To the sound that rises,  
The sacred tones that my soul embrace,  
This bestial noise is out of place.  
We are used to see, that Man despises  
What he never comprehends,  
And the Good and the Beautiful vilipends,  
Finding them often hard to measure:  
Will the dog, like man, snarl _his_ displeasure?

But ah! I feel, though will thereto be stronger,  
Contentment flows from out my breast no longer.  
Why must the stream so soon run dry and fail us,  
And burning thirst again assail us?  
Therein I've borne so much probation!  
And yet, this want may be supplied us;  
We call the Supernatural to guide us; </pre></div> </div>
