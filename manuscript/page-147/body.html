<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>FAUST</p><p>When on an idler's bed I stretch myself in quiet.<br>There let, at once, my record end!  
Canst thou with lying flattery rule me,<br>Until, self-pleased, myself I see,—<br>Canst thou with rich enjoyment fool me,<br>Let that day be the last for me!  
The bet I offer.</p><p>MEPHISTOPHELES<br>Done!</p><p>FAUST<br>And heartily!  
When thus I hail the Moment flying:<br>"Ah, still delay—thou art so fair!"<br>Then bind me in thy bonds undying,<br>My final ruin then declare!  
Then let the death-bell chime the token.<br>Then art thou from thy service free!  
The clock may stop, the hand be broken,<br>Then Time be finished unto me!</p></div> </div>
