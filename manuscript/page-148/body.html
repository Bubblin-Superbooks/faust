We pine and thirst for Revelation,  
Which nowhere worthier is, more nobly sent,  
Than here, in our New Testament.  
I feel impelled, its meaning to determine,—  
With honest purpose, once for all,  
The hallowed Original  
To change to my beloved German.  

(_He opens a volume, and commences_.)  
'Tis written: "In the Beginning was the _Word_."  
Here am I balked: who, now can help afford?  
The _Word?_—impossible so high to rate it;  
And otherwise must I translate it.  
If by the Spirit I am truly taught.  
Then thus: "In the Beginning was the _Thought_"  
This first line let me weigh completely,  
Lest my impatient pen proceed too fleetly. </pre></div> </div>
