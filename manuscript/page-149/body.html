Is it the _Thought_ which works, creates, indeed?  
"In the Beginning was the _Power,"_ I read.  
Yet, as I write, a warning is suggested,  
That I the sense may not have fairly tested.  
The Spirit aids me: now I see the light!  
"In the Beginning was the _Act_," I write.  

If I must share my chamber with thee,  
Poodle, stop that howling, prithee!  
Cease to bark and bellow!  
Such a noisy, disturbing fellow  
I'll no longer suffer near me.  
One of us, dost hear me!  
Must leave, I fear me.  
No longer guest-right I bestow;  
The door is open, art free to go.  
But what do I see in the creature? </pre></div> </div>
