Quakes the old hell-lynx there.  
Take heedâ€”look about!  
Back and forth hover,  
Under and over,  
And he'll work himself out.  
If your aid avail him,  
Let it not fail him;  
For he, without measure,  
Has wrought for our pleasure.  

FAUST

First, to encounter the beast,  
The Words of the Four be addressed:  
Salamander, shine glorious!  
Wave, Undine, as bidden!  
Sylph, be thou hidden! </pre></div> </div>
