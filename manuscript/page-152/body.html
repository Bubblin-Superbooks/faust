Gnome, be laborious!  

Who knows not their sense  
(These elements),—  
Their properties  
And power not sees,—  
No mastery he inherits  
Over the Spirits.

Vanish in flaming ether,  
Salamander!  
Flow foamingly together,  
Undine!  
Shine in meteor-sheen,  
Sylph!  
Bring help to hearth and shelf.  
Incubus! Incubus! </pre></div> </div>
