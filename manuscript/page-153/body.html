Step forward, and finish thus!  

Of the Four, no feature  
Lurks in the creature.  
Quiet he lies, and grins disdain:  
Not yet, it seems, have I given him pain.  
Now, to undisguise thee,  
Hear me exorcise thee!  
Art thou, my gay one,  
Hell's fugitive stray-one?  
The sign witness now,  
Before which they bow,  
The cohorts of Hell!

With hair all bristling, it begins to swell.

Base Being, hearest thou? </pre></div> </div>
