<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
Knowest and fearest thou  
The One, unoriginate,  
Named inexpressibly,  
Through all Heaven impermeate,  
Pierced irredressibly!  

Behind the stove still banned,  
See it, an elephant, expand!  
It fills the space entire,  
Mist-like melting, ever faster.  
'Tis enough: ascend no higher,â€”  
Lay thyself at the feet of the Master!  
Thou seest, not vain the threats I bring thee:  
With holy fire I'll scorch and sting thee!  
Wait not to know  
The threefold dazzling glow!  
Wait not to know </pre></div> </div>
