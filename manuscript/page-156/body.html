You've made me roundly sweat, that's certain!

FAUST

What is thy name?

MEPHISTOPHELES

A question small, it seems,  
For one whose mind the Word so much despises;  
Who, scorning all external gleams,  
The depths of being only prizes.

FAUST

With all you gentlemen, the name's a test,  
Whereby the nature usually is expressed. </pre></div> </div>
