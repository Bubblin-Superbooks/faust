Let but the Lying Spirit bind thee<br>With magic works and shows that blind thee,<br>And I shall have thee fast and sure!—<br>Fate such a bold, untrammelled spirit gave him,<br>As forwards, onwards, ever must endure;<br>Whose over-hasty impulse drave him<br>Past earthly joys he might secure.<br>Dragged through the wildest life, will I enslave him,<br>Through flat and stale indifference;<br>With struggling, chilling, checking, so deprave him<br>That, to his hot, insatiate sense,<br>The dream of drink shall mock, but never lave him:<br>Refreshment shall his lips in vain implore—<br>Had he not made himself the Devil's, naught could save him,<br>Still were he lost forevermore!</p></div> </div>
