Part of the Darkness which brought forth the Light,  
The haughty Light, which now disputes the space,  
And claims of Mother Night her ancient place.  
And yet, the struggle fails; since Light, howe'er it weaves,  
Still, fettered, unto bodies cleaves:  
It flows from bodies, bodies beautifies;  
By bodies is its course impeded;  
And so, but little time is needed,  
I hope, ere, as the bodies die, it dies!

FAUST

Thou canst not compass general ruin,  
And hast on smaller scale</pre></div> </div>
