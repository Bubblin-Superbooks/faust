In dry, and wet, and warm, and chilly;  
And had I not the Flame reserved, why, really,  
There's nothing special of my own to show!

FAUST

So, to the actively eternal  
Creative force, in cold disdain  
You now oppose the fist infernal,  
Whose wicked clench is all in vain!  
Some other labor seek thou rather,  
Queer Son of Chaos, to begin!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Well, we'll consider: thou canst gather  
My views, when next I venture in. </pre></div> </div>
