FAUST

One moment more I ask thee to remain,  
Some pleasant news, at least, to tell me.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Release me, now! I soon shall come again;  
Then thou, at will, mayst question and compel me.

FAUST

I have not snares around thee cast;  
Thyself hast led thyself into the meshes.  
Who traps the Devil, hold him fast!  
Not soon a second time he'll catch a prey so</pre></div> </div>
