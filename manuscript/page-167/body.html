MEPHISTOPHELES

An't please thee, also I'm content to stay,  
And serve thee in a social station;  
But stipulating, that I may  
With arts of mine afford thee recreation.

If the diversion pleasant be.

MEPHISTOPHELES

My friend, thou'lt win, past all pretences,  
More in this hour to soothe thy senses, </pre></div> </div>
