O that the darkling  
Clouds had departed!  
Starlight is sparkling,  
Tranquiller-hearted  
Suns are on high.  
Heaven's own children  
In beauty bewildering,  
Waveringly bending,  
Pass as they hover;  
Longing unending  
Follows them over.  
They, with their glowing  
Garments, out-flowing,  
Cover, in going,  
Landscape and bower,  
Where, in seclusion,  
Lovers are plighted, </pre></div> </div>
