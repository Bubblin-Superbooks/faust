Lost in illusion.  
Bower on bower!  
Tendrils unblighted!  
Lo! in a shower  
Grapes that o'ercluster  
Gush into must, or  
Flow into rivers  
Of foaming and flashing  
Wine, that is dashing  
Gems, as it boundeth  
Down the high places,  
And spreading, surroundeth  
With crystalline spaces,  
In happy embraces,  
Blossoming forelands,  
Emerald shore-lands!  
And the winged races </pre></div> </div>
