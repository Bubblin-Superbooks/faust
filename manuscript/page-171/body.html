Drink, and fly onwardâ€”  
Fly ever sunward  
To the enticing  
Islands, that flatter,  
Dipping and rising  
Light on the water!  
Hark, the inspiring  
Sound of their quiring!  
See, the entrancing  
Whirl of their dancing!  
All in the air are  
Freer and fairer.  
Some of them scaling  
Boldly the highlands,  
Others are sailing,  
Circling the islands;  
Others are flying; </pre></div> </div>
