Here rustles one that soon will work my liberation.

The lord of rats and eke of mice,  
Of flies and bed-bugs, frogs and lice,  
Summons thee hither to the door-sill,  
To gnaw it where, with just a morsel  
Of oil, he paints the spot for thee:â€”  
There com'st thou, hopping on to me!  
To work, at once! The point which made me craven  
Is forward, on the ledge, engraven.  
Another bite makes free the door:  
So, dream thy dreams, O Faust, until we meet once more!

FAUST _(awaking)_

Am I again so foully cheated? </pre></div> </div>
