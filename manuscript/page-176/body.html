MEPHISTOPHELES

Thrice must the words be spoken.  

FAUST

Come in, then!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Thus thou pleasest me.  
I hope we'll suit each other well;  
For now, thy vapors to dispel,  
I come, a squire of high degree,  
In scarlet coat, with golden trimming,  
A cloak in silken lustre swimming, </pre></div> </div>
