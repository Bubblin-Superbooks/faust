A tall cock's-feather in my hat,  
A long, sharp sword for show or quarrel,—  
And I advise thee, brief and flat,  
To don the self-same gay apparel,  
That, from this den released, and free,  
Life be at last revealed to thee!  

FAUST

This life of earth, whatever my attire,  
Would pain me in its wonted fashion.  
Too old am I to play with passion;  
Too young, to be without desire.  
What from the world have I to gain?  
Thou shalt abstain—renounce—refrain!  
Such is the everlasting song  
That in the ears of all men rings,— </pre></div> </div>
