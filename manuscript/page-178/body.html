That unrelieved, our whole life long,  
Each hour, in passing, hoarsely sings.  
In very terror I at morn awake,  
Upon the verge of bitter weeping,  
To see the day of disappointment break,  
To no one hope of mine—not one—its promise keeping:—  
That even each joy's presentiment  
With wilful cavil would diminish,  
With grinning masks of life prevent  
My mind its fairest work to finish!  
Then, too, when night descends, how anxiously  
Upon my couch of sleep I lay me:  
There, also, comes no rest to me,  
But some wild dream is sent to fray me.  
The God that in my breast is owned  
Can deeply stir the inner sources; </pre></div> </div>
