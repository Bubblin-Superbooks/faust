My thoughts from torment, led me on,  
And sweet, clear echoes came, deceiving  
A faith bequeathed from Childhood's dawn,  
Yet now I curse whate'er entices  
And snares the soul with visions vain;  
With dazzling cheats and dear devices  
Confines it in this cave of pain!  
Cursed be, at once, the high ambition  
Wherewith the mind itself deludes!  
Cursed be the glare of apparition  
That on the finer sense intrudes!  
Cursed be the lying dream's impression  
Of name, and fame, and laurelled brow!  
Cursed, all that flatters as possession,  
As wife and child, as knave and plow!  
Cursed Mammon be, when he with treasures  
To restless action spurs our fate! </pre></div> </div>
