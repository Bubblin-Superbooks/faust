Cursed when, for soft, indulgent leisures,  
He lays for us the pillows straight!  
Cursed be the vine's transcendent nectar,—  
The highest favor Love lets fall!  
Cursed, also, Hope!—cursed Faith, the spectre!  
And cursed be Patience most of all!

CHORUS OF SPIRITS (_invisible_)

Woe! woe!  
Thou hast it destroyed,  
The beautiful world,  
With powerful fist:  
In ruin 'tis hurled,  
By the blow of a demigod shattered!  
The scattered  
Fragments into the Void we carry, </pre></div> </div>
