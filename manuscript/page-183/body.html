Deploring  
The beauty perished beyond restoring.  
Mightier  
For the children of men,  
Brightlier  
Build it again,  
In thine own bosom build it anew!  
Bid the new career  
Commence,  
With clearer sense,  
And the new songs of cheer  
Be sung thereto!  

MEPHISTOPHELES  

These are the small dependants  
Who give me attendance. </pre></div> </div>
