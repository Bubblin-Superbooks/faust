Hear them, to deeds and passion  
Counsel in shrewd old-fashion!  
Into the world of strife,  
Out of this lonely life  
That of senses and sap has betrayed thee,  
They would persuade thee.  
This nursing of the pain forego thee,  
That, like a vulture, feeds upon thy breast!  
The worst society thou find'st will show thee  
Thou art a man among the rest.  
But 'tis not meant to thrust  
Thee into the mob thou hatest!  
I am not one of the greatest,  
Yet, wilt thou to me entrust  
Thy steps through life, I'll guide thee,—  
Will willingly walk beside thee,—  
Will serve thee at once and forever </pre></div> </div>
