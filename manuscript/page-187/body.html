<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
And when from these my life itself divorces,  
Let happen all that can or will!  
I'll hear no more: 'tis vain to ponder  
If there we cherish love or hate,  
Or, in the spheres we dream of yonder,  
A High and Low our souls await.  

MEPHISTOPHELES  

In this sense, even, canst thou venture.  
Come, bind thyself by prompt indenture,  
And thou mine arts with joy shalt see:  
What no man ever saw, I'll give to thee.  

FAUST  

Canst thou, poor Devil, give me whatsoever? </pre></div> </div>
