When was a human soul, in its supreme endeavor,  
E'er understood by such as thou?  
Yet, hast thou food which never satiates, now,—  
The restless, ruddy gold hast thou,  
That runs, quicksilver-like, one's fingers through,—  
A game whose winnings no man ever knew,—  
A maid that, even from my breast,  
Beckons my neighbor with her wanton glances,  
And Honor's godlike zest,  
The meteor that a moment dances,—  
Show me the fruits that, ere they're gathered, rot,  
And trees that daily with new leafage clothe them!  

MEPHISTOPHELES  

Such a demand alarms me not:  
Such treasures have I, and can show them. </pre></div> </div>
