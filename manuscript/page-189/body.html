But still the time may reach us, good my friend.  
When peace we crave and more luxurious diet.  

FAUST  

When on an idler's bed I stretch myself in quiet.  
There let, at once, my record end!  
Canst thou with lying flattery rule me,  
Until, self-pleased, myself I see,â€”  
Canst thou with rich enjoyment fool me,  
Let that day be the last for me!  
The bet I offer.  

MEPHISTOPHELES  
Done!  

FAUST </pre></div> </div>
