And heartily!  
When thus I hail the Moment flying:  
"Ah, still delayâ€”thou art so fair!"  
Then bind me in thy bonds undying,  
My final ruin then declare!  
Then let the death-bell chime the token.  
Then art thou from thy service free!  
The clock may stop, the hand be broken,  
Then Time be finished unto me!  

MEPHISTOPHELES  

Consider well: my memory good is rated.  

FAUST  

Thou hast a perfect right thereto. </pre></div> </div>
