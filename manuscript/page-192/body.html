Shall stand, with all my future days agreeing?  
In all its tides sweeps not the world away,  
And shall a promise bind my being?  
Yet this delusion in our hearts we bear:  
Who would himself therefrom deliver?  
Blest he, whose bosom Truth makes pure and fair!  
No sacrifice shall he repent of ever.  
Nathless a parchment, writ and stamped with care,  
A spectre is, which all to shun endeavor.  
The word, alas! dies even in the pen,  
And wax and leather keep the lordship then.  
What wilt from me, Base Spirit, say?â€”  
Brass, marble, parchment, paper, clay?  
The terms with graver, quill, or chisel, stated?  
I freely leave the choice to thee.
