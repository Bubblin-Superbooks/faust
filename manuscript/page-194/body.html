Fear not that I this pact shall seek to sever?  
The promise that I make to thee  
Is just the sum of my endeavor.  
I have myself inflated all too high;  
My proper place is thy estate:  
The Mighty Spirit deigns me no reply,  
And Nature shuts on me her gate.  
The thread of Thought at last is broken,  
And knowledge brings disgust unspoken.  
Let us the sensual deeps explore,  
To quench the fervors of glowing passion!  
Let every marvel take form and fashion  
Through the impervious veil it wore!  
Plunge we in Time's tumultuous dance,  
In the rush and roll of Circumstance!  
Then may delight and distress, </pre></div> </div>
