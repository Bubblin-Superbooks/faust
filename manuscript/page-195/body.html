And worry and success,  
Alternately follow, as best they can:  
Restless activity proves the man!  

MEPHISTOPHELES  

For you no bound, no term is set.  
Whether you everywhere be trying,  
Or snatch a rapid bliss in flying,  
May it agree with you, what you get!

FAUST  

But thou hast heard, 'tis not of joy we're talking.  
I take the wildering whirl, enjoyment's keenest pain,  
Enamored hate, exhilarant disdain. </pre></div> </div>
