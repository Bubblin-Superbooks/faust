My bosom, of its thirst for knowledge sated,  
Shall not, henceforth, from any pang be wrested,  
And all of life for all mankind created  
Shall be within mine inmost being tested:  
The highest, lowest forms my soul shall borrow,  
Shall heap upon itself their bliss and sorrow,  
And thus, my own sole self to all their selves expanded,  
I too, at last, shall with them all be stranded!  

MEPHISTOPHELES  

Believe me, who for many a thousand year  
The same tough meat have chewed and tested,  
That from the cradle to the bier  
No man the ancient leaven has digested!  
Trust one of us, this Whole supernal  
Is made but for a God's delight! </pre></div> </div>
