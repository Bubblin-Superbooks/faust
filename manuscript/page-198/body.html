Of the qualities of his creation,â€”  
The courage of the lion's breed,  
The wild stag's speed,  
The Italian's fiery blood,  
The North's firm fortitude!  
Let him find for thee the secret tether  
That binds the Noble and Mean together.  
And teach thy pulses of youth and pleasure  
To love by rule, and hate by measure!  
I'd like, myself, such a one to see:  
Sir Microcosm his name should be.  

FAUST  

What am I, then, if 'tis denied my part  
The crown of all humanity to win me,  
Whereto yearns every sense within me? </pre></div> </div>
