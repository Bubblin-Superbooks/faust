MEPHISTOPHELES  

Why, on the whole, thou'rt—what thou art.  
Set wigs of million curls upon thy head, to raise thee,  
Wear shoes an ell in height,—the truth betrays thee,  
And thou remainest—what thou art.  

FAUST  

I feel, indeed, that I have made the treasure  
Of human thought and knowledge mine, in vain;  
And if I now sit down in restful leisure,  
No fount of newer strength is in my brain:  
I am no hair's-breadth more in height,  
Nor nearer, to the Infinite, </pre></div> </div>
