MEPHISTOPHELES  

Good Sir, you see the facts precisely  
As they are seen by each and all.  
We must arrange them now, more wisely,  
Before the joys of life shall pall.  
Why, Zounds! Both hands and feet are, truly—  
And head and virile forces—thine:  
Yet all that I indulge in newly,  
Is't thence less wholly mine?  
If I've six stallions in my stall,  
Are not their forces also lent me?  
I speed along, completest man of all,  
As though my legs were four-and-twenty.  
Take hold, then! let reflection rest,  
And plunge into the world with zest! </pre></div> </div>
