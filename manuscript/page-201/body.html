I say to thee, a speculative wight  
Is like a beast on moorlands lean,  
That round and round some fiend misleads to evil plight,  
While all about lie pastures fresh and green.  

FAUST  

Then how shall we begin?  

MEPHISTOPHELES  

We'll try a wider sphere.  

What place of martyrdom is here!  
Is't life, I ask, is't even prudence,  
To bore thyself and bore the students? </pre></div> </div>
