Let Neighbor Paunch to that attend!  
Why plague thyself with threshing straw forever?  
The best thou learnest, in the end  
Thou dar'st not tell the youngstersâ€”never!  
I hear one's footsteps, hither steering.  

FAUST  
To see him now I have no heart.  

MEPHISTOPHELES  

So long the poor boy waits a hearing,  
He must not unconsoled depart.  
Thy cap and mantle straightway lend me!  
I'll play the comedy with art.
