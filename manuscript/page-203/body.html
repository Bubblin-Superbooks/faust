My wits, be certain, will befriend me.  
But fifteen minutes' time is all I need;  
For our fine trip, meanwhile, prepare thyself with speed!  

\[_Exit_ FAUST.  

MEPHISTOPHELES  

(_In_ FAUST'S _long mantle_.)  

Reason and Knowledge only thou despise,  
The highest strength in man that lies!  
Let but the Lying Spirit bind thee  
With magic works and shows that blind thee,  
And I shall have thee fast and sure!â€” </pre></div> </div>
