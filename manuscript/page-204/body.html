Fate such a bold, untrammelled spirit gave him,  
As forwards, onwards, ever must endure;  
Whose over-hasty impulse drave him  
Past earthly joys he might secure.  
Dragged through the wildest life, will I enslave him,  
Through flat and stale indifference;  
With struggling, chilling, checking, so deprave him  
That, to his hot, insatiate sense,  
The dream of drink shall mock, but never lave him:  
Refreshment shall his lips in vain imploreâ€”  
Had he not made himself the Devil's, naught could save him,  
Still were he lost forevermore!
