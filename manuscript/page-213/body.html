Five hours a day, you understand,  
And when the clock strikes, be on hand!  
Prepare beforehand for your part  
With paragraphs all got by heart,  
So you can better watch, and look  
That naught is said but what is in the book:  
Yet in thy writing as unwearied be,  
As did the Holy Ghost dictate to thee!  

STUDENT  

No need to tell me twice to do it!  
I think, how useful 'tis to write;  
For what one has, in black and white,  
One carries home and then goes through it.
