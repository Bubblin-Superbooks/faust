Yet choose thyself a faculty!  

STUDENT  

I cannot reconcile myself to Jurisprudence.  

MEPHISTOPHELES  

Nor can I therefore greatly blame you students:  
I know what science this has come to be.  
All rights and laws are still transmitted  
Like an eternal sickness of the race,â€”  
From generation unto generation fitted,  
And shifted round from place to place.  
Reason becomes a sham, Beneficence a worry:  
Thou art a grandchild, therefore woe to thee! </pre></div> </div>
