(_Aloud_)  

To grasp the spirit of Medicine is easy:  
Learn of the great and little world your fill,  
To let it go at last, so please ye,  
Just as God will!  
In vain that through the realms of science you may drift;  
Each one learns onlyâ€”just what learn he can:  
Yet he who grasps the Moment's gift,  
He is the proper man.  
Well-made you are, 'tis not to be denied,  
The rest a bold address will win you;  
If you but in yourself confide,  
At once confide all others in you.  
To lead the women, learn the special feeling! </pre></div> </div>
