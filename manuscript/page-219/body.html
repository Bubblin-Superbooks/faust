Their everlasting aches and groans,  
In thousand tones,  
Have all one source, one mode of healing;  
And if your acts are half discreet,  
You'll always have them at your feet.  
A title first must draw and interest them,  
And show that yours all other arts exceeds;  
Then, as a greeting, you are free to touch and test them,  
While, thus to do, for years another pleads.  
You press and count the pulse's dances,  
And then, with burning sidelong glances,  
You clasp the swelling hips, to see  
If tightly laced her corsets be.
