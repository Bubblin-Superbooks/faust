As best it pleases thee.  

The little world, and then the great, we'll see.  
With what delight, what profit winning,  
Shalt thou sponge through the term beginning!  

FAUST  

Yet with the flowing beard I wear,  
Both ease and grace will fail me there.  
The attempt, indeed, were a futile strife;  
I never could learn the ways of life.  
I feel so small before others, and thence  
Should always find embarrassments.
