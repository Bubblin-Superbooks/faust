My friend, thou soon shalt lose all such misgiving:  
Be thou but self-possessed, thou hast the art of living!  

FAUST  

How shall we leave the house, and start?  
Where hast thou servant, coach and horses?  

MEPHISTOPHELES  

We'll spread this cloak with proper art,  
Then through the air direct our courses.  
But only, on so bold a flight,  
Be sure to have thy luggage light.  
A little burning air, which I shall soon prepare us,  
Above the earth will nimbly bear us, </pre></div> </div>
