CAROUSAL OF JOLLY COMPANIONS  

FROSCH  

Is no one laughing? no one drinking?  
I'll teach you how to grin, I'm thinking.  
To-day you're like wet straw, so tame;  
And usually you're all aflame.  

BRANDER  

Now that's your fault; from you we nothing see,  
No beastliness and no stupidity. </pre></div> </div>
