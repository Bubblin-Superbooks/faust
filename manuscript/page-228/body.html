<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
With open throat sing chorus, drink and roar!  
Up! holla! ho!  

ALTMAYER  

Woe's me, the fearful bellow!  
Bring cotton, quick! He's split my ears, that fellow.  

SIEBEL  

When the vault echoes to the song,  
One first perceives the bass is deep and strong.  

FROSCH  

Well said! and out with him that takes the least offence! </pre></div> </div>
