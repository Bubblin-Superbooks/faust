BRANDER  

A nasty song! Fie! a political songâ€”  
A most offensive song! Thank God, each morning, therefore,  
That you have not the Roman realm to care for!  
At least, I hold it so much gain for me,  
That I nor Chancellor nor Kaiser be.  
Yet also we must have a ruling head, I hope,  
And so we'll choose ourselves a Pope.  
You know the quality that can  
Decide the choice, and elevate the man.
