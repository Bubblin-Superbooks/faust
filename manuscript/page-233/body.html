Perchance my love, amid the childish band,<br>Grateful for gifts the Holy Christmas gave her,<br>Here meekly kissed the grandsire's withered hand.<br>I feel, O maid! thy very soul<br>Of order and content around me whisper,â€”<br>Which leads thee with its motherly control,<br>The cloth upon thy board bids smoothly thee unroll,<br>The sand beneath thy feet makes whiter, crisper.<br>O dearest hand, to thee 'tis given<br>To change this hut into a lower heaven!  
And here!</p><p>(<em>He lifts one of the bed-curtains</em>.)</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">What sweetest thrill is in my blood!  
Here could I spend whole hours, delaying:<br>Here Nature shaped, as if in sportive playing,<br>The angel blossom from the bud.<br>Here lay the child, with Life's warm</p></div> </div>
