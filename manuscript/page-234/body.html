What seek I? Why so full my heart, and sore?<br>Miserable Faust! I know thee now no more.</p><p>Is there a magic vapor here?<br>I came, with lust of instant pleasure,<br>And lie dissolved in dreams of love's sweet leisure!

How small the giant lout would be,<br>Prone at her feet, relaxed and tender!</p><p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p><p>Be quick! I see her there, returning.</p></div> </div>
