As if he had love in his bosom.  

CHORUS (_shouting_)  

As if he had love in his bosom!  

BRANDER  

He ran around, he ran about,  
His thirst in puddles laving;  
He gnawed and scratched the house throughout.  
But nothing cured his raving.  
He whirled and jumped, with torment mad,  
And soon enough the poor beast had,  
As if he had love in his bosom.  

CHORUS </pre></div> </div>
