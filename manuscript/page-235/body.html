As if he had love in his bosom!  

BRANDER  

And driven at last, in open day,  
He ran into the kitchen,  
Fell on the hearth, and squirming lay,  
In the last convulsion twitching.  
Then laughed the murderess in her glee:  
"Ha! ha! he's at his last gasp," said she,  
"As if he had love in his bosom!"  

CHORUS

As if he had love in his bosom! </pre></div> </div>
