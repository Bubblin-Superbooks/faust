A cross upon his breast.  
He had the first of stations,  
A minister's star and name;  
And also all his relations  
Great lords at court became.  

And the lords and ladies of honor  
Were plagued, awake and in bed;  
The queen she got them upon her,  
The maids were bitten and bled.  
And they did not dare to brush them,  
Or scratch them, day or night:  
We crack them and we crush them,  
At once, whene'er they bite.  

CHORUS (_shouting_) </pre></div> </div>
