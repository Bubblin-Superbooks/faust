MEPHISTOPHELES

I fain would drink with you, my glass to Freedom clinking,  
If 'twere a better wine that here I see you drinking.

SIEBEL

Don't let us hear that speech again!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Did I not fear the landlord might complain,  
I'd treat these worthy guests, with pleasure,  
To some from out our cellar's</pre></div> </div>
