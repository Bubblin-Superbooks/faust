BRANDER

What's foreign one can't always keep quite clear of,  
For good things, oft, are not so near;  
A German can't endure the French to see or hear of,  
Yet drinks their wines with hearty cheer.

SIEBEL

(_as_ MEPHISTOPHELES _approaches his seat_)  
For me, I grant, sour wine is out of place;  
Fill up my glass with sweetest, will you?

MEPHISTOPHELES (_boring_)

Tokay shall flow at once, to fill</pre></div> </div>
