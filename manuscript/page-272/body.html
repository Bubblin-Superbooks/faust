(_Upon a low hearth stands a great caldron, under which a fire  
is burning. Various figures appear in the vapors which  
rise from the caldron. An ape sits beside it, skims it, and  
watches lest it boil over. The he-ape, with the young  
ones, sits near and warms himself. Ceiling and walls are  
covered with the most fantastic witch-implements_.)
