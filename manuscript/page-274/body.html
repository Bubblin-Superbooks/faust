FAUST

Yet will I know it.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Good! the method is revealed  
Without or gold or magic or physician.  
Betake thyself to yonder field,  
There hoe and dig, as thy condition;  
Restrain thyself, thy sense and will  
Within a narrow sphere to flourish;  
With unmixed food thy body nourish;  
Live with the ox as ox, and think it not a theft  
That thou manur'st the acre which thou reapest;â€”  
That, trust me, is the best mode left, </pre></div> </div>
