THE HE-APE (_taking it down_)

Wert thou the thief,  
I'd know him and shame him.  

(_He runs to the_ SHE-APE, _and lets her look through it_.)  

Look through the sieve!  
Know'st thou the thief,  
And darest not name him?  

MEPHISTOPHELES (_approaching the fire)_

And what's this</pre></div> </div>
