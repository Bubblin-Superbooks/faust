FAUST

(_who during all this time has been standing before a mirror,  
now approaching and now retreating from it_)

What do I see? What heavenly form revealed  
Shows through the glass from Magic's fair dominions!  
O lend me, Love, the swiftest of thy pinions,  
And bear me to her beauteous field!  
Ah, if I leave this spot with fond designing,  
If I attempt to venture near,  
Dim, as through gathering mist, her charms appear!â€”  
A woman's form, in beauty shining!  
Can woman, then, so lovely be?  
And must I find her body, there reclining, </pre></div> </div>
