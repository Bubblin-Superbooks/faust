and striding among the jars and glasses_)

In two! in two!  
There lies the brew!  
There lies the glass!  
The joke will pass,  
As time, foul ass!  
To the singing of thy crew.  

(_As the_ WITCH _starts back, full of wrath and horror_)

Ha! know'st thou me? Abomination, thou!  
Know'st thou, at last, thy Lord and Master?  
What hinders me from smiting now  
Thee and thy monkey-sprites with fell disaster?  
Hast for the scarlet coat no reverence? </pre></div> </div>
