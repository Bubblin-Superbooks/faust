Dost recognize no more the tall cock's-feather?  
Have I concealed this countenance?â€”  
Must tell my name, old face of leather?

THE WITCH

O pardon, Sir, the rough salute!  
Yet I perceive no cloven foot;  
And both your ravens, where are _they_ now?

For since we two together met,  
'Tis verily full many a day now.  
Culture, which smooth the whole world licks,  
Also unto the Devil sticks. </pre></div> </div>
