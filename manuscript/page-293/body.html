The days of that old Northern phantom now are over:  
Where canst thou horns and tail and claws discover?  
And, as regards the foot, which I can't spare, in truth,  
'Twould only make the people shun me;  
Therefore I've worn, like many a spindly youth,  
False calves these many years upon me.

THE WITCH (_dancing_)

Reason and sense forsake my brain,  
Since I behold Squire Satan here again!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Woman, from such a name refrain!
