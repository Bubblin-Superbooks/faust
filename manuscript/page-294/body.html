Why so? What has it done to thee?

MEPHISTOPHELES

It's long been written in the Book of Fable;  
Yet, therefore, no whit better men we see:  
The Evil One has left, the evil ones are stable.  
Sir Baron call me thou, then is the matter good;  
A cavalier am I, like others in my bearing.  
Thou hast no doubt about my noble blood:  
See, here's the coat-of-arms that I am wearing!
