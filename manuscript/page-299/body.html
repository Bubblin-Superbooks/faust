THE WITCH

(_begins to declaim, with much emphasis, from the book_)

See, thus it's done!  
Make ten of one,  
And two let be,  
Make even three,  
And rich thou 'It be.  
Cast o'er the four!  
From five and six  
(The witch's tricks)  
Make seven and eight,  
'Tis finished straight!  
And nine is one, </pre></div> </div>
