Error instead of Truth to scatter.  
They prate and teach, and no one interferes;  
All from the fellowship of fools are shrinking.  
Man usually believes, if only words he hears,  
That also with them goes material for thinking!

THE WITCH (_continues_)

The lofty skill  
Of Science, still  
From all men deeply hidden!  
Who takes no thought,  
To him 'tis brought,  
'Tis given unsought, unbidden! </pre></div> </div>
