Come, walk at once! A rapid occupation  
Must start the needful perspiration,  
And through thy frame the liquor's potence fling.  
The noble indolence I'll teach thee then to treasure,  
And soon thou'lt be aware, with keenest thrills of pleasure,  
How Cupid stirs and leaps, on light and restless wing.

FAUST

One rapid glance within the mirror give me,  
How beautiful that woman-form!

MEPHISTOPHELES

No, no! The paragon of all, believe me, </pre></div> </div>
