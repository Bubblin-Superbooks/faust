<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
I claim, I tell thee, all my right;  
And if that image of delight  
Rest not within mine arms to-night,  
At midnight is our compact broken.

MEPHISTOPHELES

But think, the chances of the case!  
I need, at least, a fortnight's space,  
To find an opportune occasion.

FAUST

Had I but seven hours for all,  
I should not on the Devil call,  
But win her by my own</pre></div> </div>
