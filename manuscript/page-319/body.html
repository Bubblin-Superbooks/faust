<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Thou seest the Father;<br>Thy sad sighs gather,<br>And bear aloft Thy sorrow and His pain!</p><p>Ah, past guessing,<br>Beyond expressing,<br>The pangs that wring my flesh and bone!  
Why this anxious heart so burneth,<br>Why it trembleth, why it yearneth,<br>Knowest Thou, and Thou alone!</p><p>Where'er I go, what sorrow,<br>What woe, what woe and sorrow<br>Within my bosom aches!  
Alone, and ah! unsleeping,<br>I'm weeping, weeping, weeping,<br>The heart within me breaks.</p><p>The pots before my window,<br>Alas! my tears did wet,<br>As in the early morning<br>For thee these flowers I set.</p></div> </div>
