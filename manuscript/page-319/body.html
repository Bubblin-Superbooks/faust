EVENING A SMALL, NEATLY KEPT CHAMBER

MARGARET

(_plaiting and binding up the braids of her hair_)

I'd something give, could I but say  
Who was that gentleman, to-day.  
Surely a gallant man was he,  
And of a noble family;  
And much could I in his face behold,â€”  
And he wouldn't, else, have been so bold!
