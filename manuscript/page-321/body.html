O welcome, twilight soft and sweet,  
That breathes throughout this hallowed shrine!  
Sweet pain of love, bind thou with fetters fleet  
The heart that on the dew of hope must pine!  
How all around a sense impresses  
Of quiet, order, and content!  
This poverty what bounty blesses!  
What bliss within this narrow den is pent!

(_He throws himself into a leathern arm-chair near the bed_.)

Receive me, thou, that in thine open arms  
Departed joy and pain wert wont to gather!  
How oft the children, with their ruddy charms,  
Hung here, around this throne, where sat the father! </pre></div> </div>
