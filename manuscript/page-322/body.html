<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">say,<br>Smiling, the bumper in my hand:<br>"Each well enough in her own way.<br>But is there one in all the land<br>Like sister Margaret, good as gold,—<br>One that to her can a candle hold?"<br>Cling! clang! "Here's to her!" went around<br>The board: "He speaks the truth!" cried some;<br>"In her the flower o' the sex is found!"<br>And all the swaggerers were dumb.<br>And now!—I could tear my hair with vexation.<br>And dash out my brains in desperation!  
With turned-up nose each scamp may face me,<br>With sneers and stinging taunts disgrace me,<br>And, like a bankrupt debtor sitting,<br>A chance-dropped word may set me sweating!  
Yet, though I thresh them all together,<br>I cannot call them liars, either.</p></div> </div>
