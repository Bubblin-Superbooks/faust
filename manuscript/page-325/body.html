<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
I swear, 'twill turn her head, to spy it:  
Some baubles I therein had placed,  
That you might win another by it.  
True, child is child, and play is play.

FAUST

I know not, should I do it?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ask you, pray?

Yourself, perhaps, would keep the bubble?  
Then I suggest, 'twere fair and just  
To spare the lovely day your lust,  
And spare to me the further trouble. </pre></div> </div>
