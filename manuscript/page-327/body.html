It is so close, so sultry, here!

(_She opens the window_)

And yet 'tis not so warm outside.  
I feel, I know not why, such fear!—  
Would mother came!—where can she bide?  
My body's chill and shuddering,—  
I'm but a silly, fearsome thing!

(_She begins to sing while undressing_)

There was a King in Thule,  
Was faithful till the grave,—  
To whom his mistress, dying,  
A golden goblet gave. </pre></div> </div>
