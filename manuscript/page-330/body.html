And mother gave a loan thereon?  
And here there hangs a key to fit:  
I have a mind to open it.  
What is that? God in Heaven! Whence came  
Such things? Never beheld I aught so fair!  
Rich ornaments, such as a noble dame  
On highest holidays might wear!  
How would the pearl-chain suit my hair?  
Ah, who may all this splendor own?

(_She adorns herself with the jewelry, and steps before the  
mirror_.)

Were but the ear-rings mine, alone!  
One has at once another air.  
What helps one's beauty, youthful blood? </pre></div> </div>
