<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">light.<br>The time I verily can discern<br>When all the honest folk will turn<br>From thee, thou jade! and seek protection<br>As from a corpse that breeds infection.<br>Thy guilty heart shall then dismay thee.<br>When they but look thee in the face:â€”<br>Shalt not in a golden chain array thee,<br>Nor at the altar take thy place!  
Shalt not, in lace and ribbons flowing,<br>Make merry when the dance is going!  
But in some corner, woe betide thee!  
Among the beggars and cripples hide thee;<br>And so, though even God forgive,<br>On earth a damned existence live!</p><p>MARTHA</p><p>Commend your soul to God for pardon,<br>That you your heart with slander harden!</p></div> </div>
