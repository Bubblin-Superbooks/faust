Margaret!  
Where tends thy thought?<br>Within thy bosom<br>What hidden crime?<br>Pray'st thou for mercy on thy mother's soul,<br>That fell asleep to long, long torment, and through thee?<br>Upon thy threshold whose the blood?<br>And stirreth not and quickens<br>Something beneath thy heart,<br>Thy life disquieting<br>With most foreboding presence?</p><p>MARGARET</p><p>Woe! woe!  
Would I were free from the thoughts<br>That cross me, drawing hither and thither<br>Despite me!</p><p>CHORUS</p></div> </div>
