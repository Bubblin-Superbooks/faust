Keen scent has she for tainted air;  
She snuffs within her book of prayer,  
And smells each article, to see  
If sacred or profane it be;  
So here she guessed, from every gem,  
That not much blessing came with them.  
"My child," she said, "ill-gotten good  
Ensnares the soul, consumes the blood.  
Before the Mother of God we'll lay it;  
With heavenly manna she'll repay it!"  
But Margaret thought, with sour grimace,  
"A gift-horse is not out of place,  
And, truly! godless cannot be  
The one who brought such things to me."  
A parson came, by the mother bidden:  
He saw, at once, where the game was hidden,  
And viewed it with a favor stealthy. </pre></div> </div>
