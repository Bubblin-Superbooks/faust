FAUST

The darling's sorrow gives me pain.  
Get thou a set for her again!  
The first was not a great display.

MEPHISTOPHELES

O yes, the gentleman finds it all child's-play!

FAUST

Fix and arrange it to my will;  
And on her neighbor try thy skill!  
Don't be a Devil stiff as paste,  
But get fresh jewels to her</pre></div> </div>
