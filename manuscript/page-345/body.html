<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>How strangely glimmers through the hollows<br>A dreary light, like that of dawn!  
Its exhalation tracks and follows<br>The deepest gorges, faint and wan.<br>Here steam, there rolling vapor sweepeth;<br>Here burns the glow through film and haze:<br>Now like a tender thread it creepeth,<br>Now like a fountain leaps and plays.<br>Here winds away, and in a hundred<br>Divided veins the valley braids:<br>There, in a corner pressed and sundered,<br>Itself detaches, spreads and fades.<br>Here gush the sparkles incandescent<br>Like scattered showers of golden sand;â€”<br>But, see! in all their height, at present,<br>The rocky ramparts blazing stand.</p></div> </div>
