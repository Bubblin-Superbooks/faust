<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">retreating,<br>Hold fast, lest thou be hurled down the abysses there!  
The night with the mist is black;<br>Hark! how the forests grind and crack!  
Frightened, the owlets are scattered:<br>Hearken! the pillars are shattered.<br>The evergreen palaces shaking!  
Boughs are groaning and breaking,<br>The tree-trunks terribly thunder,<br>The roots are twisting asunder!  
In frightfully intricate crashing<br>Each on the other is dashing,<br>And over the wreck-strewn gorges<br>The tempest whistles and surges!  
Hear'st thou voices higher ringing?<br>Far away, or nearer singing?<br>Yes, the mountain's side along,<br>Sweeps an infuriate glamouring song!</p></div> </div>
