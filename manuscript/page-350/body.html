<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>O'er the Ilsen-stone.<br>I peeped at the owl in her nest alone:<br>How she stared and glared!</p><p>VOICE</p><p>Betake thee to Hell!  
Why so fast and so fell?</p><p>VOICE</p><p>She has scored and has flayed me:<br>See the wounds she has made me!</p><p>WITCHES (<em>chorus</em>)</p><p>The way is wide, the way is long:<br>See, what a wild and crazy throng!  
The broom it scratches, the fork it thrusts,<br>The child is stifled, the mother bursts.</p><p>WIZARDS (<em>semichorus</em>)</p><p>As doth the snail in shell, we crawl:<br>Before us go the women all.<br>When towards the Devil's House we tread,<br>Woman's a thousand steps ahead.</p></div> </div>
