MEPHISTOPHELES

Now, there you are! O holy man!  
Is it the first time in your life you're driven  
To bear false witness in a case?  
Of God, the world and all that in it has a place,  
Of Man, and all that moves the being of his race,  
Have you not terms and definitions given  
With brazen forehead, daring breast?  
And, if you'll probe the thing profoundly,  
Knew you so much—and you'll confess it roundly!—  
As here of Schwerdtlein's death and place of rest?

FAUST

Thou art, and thou remain'st, a sophist,</pre></div> </div>
