Is so exact!  
Not that she needs so much to keep expenses down:  
We, more than others, might take comfort, rather:  
A nice estate was left us by my father,  
A house, a little garden near the town.  
But now my days have less of noise and hurry;  
My brother is a soldier,  
My little sister's dead.  
True, with the child a troubled life I led,  
Yet I would take again, and willing, all the worry,  
So very dear was she.
