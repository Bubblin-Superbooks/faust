FAUST

The purest bliss was surely then thy dower.

MARGARET

But surely, also, many a weary hour.  
I kept the baby's cradle near  
My bed at night: if 't even stirred, I'd guess it,  
And waking, hear.  
And I must nurse it, warm beside me press it,  
And oft, to quiet it, my bed forsake,  
And dandling back and forth the restless creature take,  
Then at the wash-tub stand, at morning's break;  
And then the marketing and kitchen-tending,  
Day after day, the same thing, never-ending. </pre></div> </div>
