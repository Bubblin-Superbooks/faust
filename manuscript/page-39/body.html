I bring the unknown multitude my treasures;<br>Their very plaudits give my heart a pang,<br>And those beside, whose joy my Song so flattered,<br>If still they live, wide through the world are scattered.</p><p>And grasps me now a long-unwonted yearning<br>For that serene and solemn Spirit-Land:<br>My song, to faint Aeolian murmurs turning,<br>Sways like a harp-string by the breezes fanned.<br>I thrill and tremble; tear on tear is burning,<br>And the stern heart is tenderly unmanned.<br>What I possess, I see far distant lying,<br>And what I lost, grows real and undying.</p></div> </div>
