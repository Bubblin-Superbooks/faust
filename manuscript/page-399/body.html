<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">thee?<br>Let me not vainly entreat thee!  
I never chanced, in all my days, to meet thee!</p><p>FAUST</p><p>Shall I outlive this misery?</p><p>MARGARET</p><p>Now am I wholly in thy might.<br>But let me suckle, first, my baby!  
I blissed it all this livelong night;<br>They took 't away, to vex me, maybe,<br>And now they say I killed the child outright.<br>And never shall I be glad again.<br>They sing songs about me! 'tis bad of the folk to do it!  
There's an old story has the same refrain;<br>Who bade them so construe it?</p><p>FAUST (<em>falling upon his knees</em>)</p><p>Here lieth one who loves thee ever,<br>The thraldom of thy woe to sever.</p></div> </div>
