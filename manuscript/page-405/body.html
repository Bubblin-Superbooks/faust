Demeans me to myself, and with a breath,  
A word, transforms thy gifts to nothingness.  
Within my breast he fans a lawless fire,  
Unwearied, for that fair and lovely form:  
Thus in desire I hasten to enjoyment,  
And in enjoyment pine to feel desire.

But something new must then requite</pre></div> </div>
