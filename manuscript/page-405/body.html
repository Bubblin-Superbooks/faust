<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">us.<br>Now I'll tell thee the graves to give us:<br>Thou must begin to-morrow<br>The work of sorrow!  
The best place give to my mother,<br>Then close at her side my brother,<br>And me a little away,<br>But not too very far, I pray!  
And here, on my right breast, my baby lay!  
Nobody else will lie beside me!â€”<br>Ah, within thine arms to hide me,<br>That was a sweet and a gracious bliss,<br>But no more, no more can I attain it!  
I would force myself on thee and constrain it,<br>And it seems thou repellest my kiss:<br>And yet 'tis thou, so good, so kind to see!</p><p>FAUST</p><p>If thou feel'st it is I, then come with me!</p><p>MARGARET</p><p>Out yonder?</p></div> </div>
