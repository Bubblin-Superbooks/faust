From here to eternal rest:<br>No further stepâ€”no, no!  
Thou goest away! O Henry, if I could go!</p><p>FAUST</p><p>Thou canst! Just will it! Open stands the door.</p><p>MARGARET</p><p>I dare not go: there's no hope any more.<br>Why should I fly? They'll still my steps waylay!

It is so wretched, to be strange, forsaken,<br>And I'd still be followed and taken!</p><p>FAUST</p></div> </div>
