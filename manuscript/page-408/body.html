FAUST


There is, again, thy proper tone!â€”  
That thou hast bored me, I must thankful be!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Poor Son of Earth, how couldst thou thus alone  
Have led thy life, bereft of me?  
I, for a time, at least, have worked thy cure;  
Thy fancy's rickets plague thee not at all:  
Had I not been, so hadst thou, sure,  
Walked thyself off this earthly ball  
Why here to caverns, rocky hollows slinking,  
Sit'st thou, as 'twere an owl a-blinking? </pre></div> </div>
