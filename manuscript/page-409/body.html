There sits my mother upon a stone,—<br>I feel an icy shiver!  
There sits my mother upon a stone,<br>And her head is wagging ever.<br>She beckons, she nods not, her heavy head falls o'er;<br>She slept so long that she wakes no more.<br>She slept, while we were caressing:<br>Ah, those were the days of blessing!</p><p>FAUST</p><p>Here words and prayers are nothing worth;<br>I'll venture, then, to bear thee forth.</p><p>MARGARET</p><p>No—let me go! I'll suffer no force!  
Grasp me not so murderously!  
I've done, else, all things for the love of thee.</p><p>FAUST</p><p>The day dawns: Dearest! Dearest!</p></div> </div>
