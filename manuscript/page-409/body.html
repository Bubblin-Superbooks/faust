Why suck'st, from sodden moss and dripping stone,  
Toad-like, thy nourishment alone?  
A fine way, this, thy time to fill!  
The Doctor's in thy body still.

What fresh and vital forces, canst thou guess,  
Spring from my commerce with the wilderness?

Thou wouldst be devil enough to grudge my soul the blessing.

MEPHISTOPHELES

A blessing drawn from supernatural fountains!  
In night and dew to lie upon the mountains; </pre></div> </div>
