<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
All Heaven and Earth in rapture penetrating;  
Thyself to Godhood haughtily inflating;  
To grub with yearning force through Earth's dark marrow,  
Compress the six days' work within thy bosom narrow,—  
To taste, I know not what, in haughty power,  
Thine own ecstatic life on all things shower,  
Thine earthly self behind thee cast,  
And then the lofty instinct, thus—

(_With a gesture_:)

at last,—

I daren't say how—to pluck the final flower! </pre></div> </div>
