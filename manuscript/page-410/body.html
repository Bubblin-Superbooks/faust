<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>MARGARET</p><p>Day? Yes, the day comes,—the last day breaks for me!  
My wedding-day it was to be!  
Tell no one thou has been with Margaret!  
Woe for my garland! The chances<br>Are over—'tis all in vain!  
We shall meet once again,<br>But not at the dances!  
The crowd is thronging, no word is spoken:<br>The square below<br>And the streets overflow:<br>The death-bell tolls, the wand is broken.<br>I am seized, and bound, and delivered—<br>Shoved to the block—they give the sign!  
Now over each neck has quivered<br>The blade that is quivering over mine.<br>Dumb lies the world like the grave!</p><p>FAUST</p><p>O had I ne'er been born!</p><p>MEPHISTOPHELES (<em>appears outside</em>)</p></div> </div>
