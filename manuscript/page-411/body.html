FAUST

Shame on thee!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Yes, thou findest that unpleasant!  
Thou hast the moral right to cry me "shame!" at present.  
One dares not that before chaste ears declare,  
Which chaste hearts, notwithstanding, cannot spare;  
And, once for all, I grudge thee not the pleasure  
Of lying to thyself in moderate measure.  
But such a course thou wilt not long endure;  
Already art thou o'er-excited,  
And, if it last, wilt soon be plighted </pre></div> </div>
