To madness and to horror, sure.  
Enough of that! Thy love sits lonely yonder,  
By all things saddened and oppressed;  
Her thoughts and yearnings seek thee, tenderer, fonder,â€”  
mighty love is in her breast.  
First came thy passion's flood and poured around her  
As when from melted snow a streamlet overflows;  
Thou hast therewith so filled and drowned her,  
That now _thy_ stream all shallow shows.  
Methinks, instead of in the forests lording,  
The noble Sir should find it good,  
The love of this young silly blood  
At once to set about rewarding.  
Her time is miserably long;  
She haunts her window, watching clouds that stray  
O'er the old city-wall, and far away. </pre></div> </div>
