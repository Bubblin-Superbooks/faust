FAUST

Get thee away with thine offences,  
Reprobate! Name not that fairest thing,  
Nor the desire for her sweet body bring  
Again before my half-distracted senses!

MEPHISTOPHELES

What wouldst thou, then? She thinks that thou art flown;  
And half and half thou art, I own.

FAUST

Yet am I near, and love keeps watch and ward; </pre></div> </div>
