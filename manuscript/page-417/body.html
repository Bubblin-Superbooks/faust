Her simple, homely life commences,  
Her little world therein concealed.  
And I, God's hate flung o'er me,  
Had not enough, to thrust  
The stubborn rocks before me  
And strike them into dust!  
She and her peace I yet must undermine:  
Thou, Hell, hast claimed this sacrifice as thine!  
Help, Devil! through the coming pangs to push me;  
What must be, let it quickly be!  
Let fall on me her fate, and also crush me,â€”  
One ruin whelm both her and me!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Again it seethes, again it glows!  
Thou fool, go in and comfort her! </pre></div> </div>
