<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
When such a head as thine no outlet knows,  
It thinks the end must soon occur.  
Hail him, who keeps a steadfast mind!  
Thou, else, dost well the devil-nature wear:  
Naught so insipid in the world I find  
As is a devil in despair.</code></pre><img width = "98%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/faust/master/assets/images/Illus-177.jpg" /><hr class="section"></div> </div>
