His noble size,  
The smile of his mouth,  
The power of his eyes,  

And the magic flow  
Of his talk, the bliss  
In the clasp of his hand,  
And, ah! his kiss!  

My peace is gone,  
My heart is sore:  
I never shall find it,  
Ah, nevermore!  

My bosom yearns  
For him alone;  
Ah, dared I clasp him, </pre></div> </div>
