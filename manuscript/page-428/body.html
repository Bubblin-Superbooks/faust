Who dare express Him?  
And who profess Him,  
Saying: I believe in Him!  
Who, feeling, seeing,  
Deny His being,  
Saying: I believe Him not!  
The All-enfolding,  
The All-upholding,  
Folds and upholds he not  
Thee, me, Himself?  
Arches not there the sky above us?  
Lies not beneath us, firm, the earth?  
And rise not, on us shining,  
Friendly, the everlasting stars?  
Look I not, eye to eye, on thee,  
And feel'st not, thronging  
To head and heart, the force, </pre></div> </div>
