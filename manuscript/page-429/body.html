Still weaving its eternal secret,  
Invisible, visible, round thy life?  
Vast as it is, fill with that force thy heart,  
And when thou in the feeling wholly blessed art,  
Call it, then, what thou wilt,â€”  
Call it Bliss! Heart! Love! God!  
I have no name to give it!  
Feeling is all in all:  
The Name is sound and smoke,  
Obscuring Heaven's clear glow.

Much the same way the preacher spoke,  
Only with slightly different</pre></div> </div>
