FAUST

Foreboding angel that thou art!

MARGARET

It overcomes me in such degree,  
That wheresoe'er he meets us, even,  
I feel as though I'd lost my love for thee.  
When he is by, I could not pray to Heaven.  
That burns within me like a flame,  
And surely, Henry, 'tis with thee the same.

FAUST

There, now, is thine</pre></div> </div>
