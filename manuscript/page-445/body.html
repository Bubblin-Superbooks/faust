MARGARET

Ah!

LISBETH

And so, at last, it serves her rightly.  
She clung to the fellow so long and tightly!  
That was a promenading!  
At village and dance parading!  
As the first they must everywhere shine,  
And he treated her always to pies and wine,  
And she made a to-do with her face so fine;  
So mean and shameless was her behavior,  
She took all the presents the fellow gave her.  
'Twas kissing and coddling, on and on! </pre></div> </div>
