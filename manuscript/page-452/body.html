Thou lookest up to where Thy Son is slain!  

Thou seest the Father;  
Thy sad sighs gather,  
And bear aloft Thy sorrow and His pain!  

Ah, past guessing,  
Beyond expressing,  
The pangs that wring my flesh and bone!  
Why this anxious heart so burneth,  
Why it trembleth, why it yearneth,  
Knowest Thou, and Thou alone!  

Where'er I go, what sorrow,  
What woe, what woe and sorrow  
Within my bosom aches!  
Alone, and ah! unsleeping, </pre></div> </div>
