<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
I'm weeping, weeping, weeping,  
The heart within me breaks.  

The pots before my window,  
Alas! my tears did wet,  
As in the early morning  
For thee these flowers I set.  

Within my lonely chamber  
The morning sun shone red:  
I sat, in utter sorrow,  
Already on my bed.  

Help! rescue me from death and stain!  
O Maiden!  
Thou sorrow-laden,  
Incline Thy countenance upon my pain!  </code></pre></div> </div>
