Smiling, the bumper in my hand:  
"Each well enough in her own way.  
But is there one in all the land  
Like sister Margaret, good as gold,—  
One that to her can a candle hold?"  
Cling! clang! "Here's to her!" went around  
The board: "He speaks the truth!" cried some;  
"In her the flower o' the sex is found!"  
And all the swaggerers were dumb.

And dash out my brains in desperation!  
With turned-up nose each scamp may face me,  
With sneers and stinging taunts disgrace me,  
And, like a bankrupt debtor sitting,  
A chance-dropped word may set me sweating!  
Yet, though I thresh them all together,  
I cannot call them liars,</pre></div> </div>
