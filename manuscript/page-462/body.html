What dost thou here  
In daybreak clear,  
Kathrina dear,  
Before thy lover's door?  
Beware! the blade  
Lets in a maid.  
That out a maid  
Departeth nevermore!  

The coaxing shun  
Of such an one!  
When once 'tis done  
Good-night to thee, poor thing!  
Love's time is brief:  
Unto no thief  
Be warm and lief, </pre></div> </div>
