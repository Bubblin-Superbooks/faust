VALENTINE

I'm dying! That is quickly said,  
And quicker yet 'tis done.  
Why howl, you women there? Instead,  
Come here and listen, every one!

(_All gather around him_)

My Margaret, see! still young thou art,  
But not the least bit shrewd or smart,  
Thy business thus to slight:  
So this advice I bid thee heedâ€”  
Now that thou art a whore indeed,  
Why, be one then,</pre></div> </div>
