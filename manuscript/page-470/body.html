My brother! God! such words to me?

VALENTINE

In this game let our Lord God be!  
What's done's already done, alas!  
What follows it, must come to pass.  
With one begin'st thou secretly,  
Then soon will others come to thee,  
And when a dozen thee have known,  
Thou'rt also free to all the town.  
When Shame is born and first appears,  
She is in secret brought to light,  
And then they draw the veil of night </pre></div> </div>
