Over her head and ears;  
Her life, in fact, they're loath to spare her.  
But let her growth and strength display,  
She walks abroad unveiled by day,  
Yet is not grown a whit the fairer.  
The uglier she is to sight,  
The more she seeks the day's broad light.  
The time I verily can discern  
When all the honest folk will turn  
From thee, thou jade! and seek protection  
As from a corpse that breeds infection.  
Thy guilty heart shall then dismay thee.  
When they but look thee in the face:â€”  
Shalt not in a golden chain array thee,  
Nor at the altar take thy place!  
Shalt not, in lace and ribbons flowing,  
Make merry when the dance is going! </pre></div> </div>
