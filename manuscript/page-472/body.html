But in some corner, woe betide thee!  
Among the beggars and cripples hide thee;  
And so, though even God forgive,  
On earth a damned existence live!

MARTHA

Commend your soul to God for pardon,  
That you your heart with slander harden!

VALENTINE

Thou pimp most infamous, be still!  
Could I thy withered body kill,  
'Twould bring, for all my sinful pleasure,  
Forgiveness in the richest</pre></div> </div>
