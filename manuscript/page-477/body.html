Half God within thee!  
Margaret!  
Where tends thy thought?  
Within thy bosom  
What hidden crime?  
Pray'st thou for mercy on thy mother's soul,  
That fell asleep to long, long torment, and through thee?  
Upon thy threshold whose the blood?  
And stirreth not and quickens  
Something beneath thy heart,  
Thy life disquieting  
With most foreboding presence?

MARGARET

Woe! woe! </pre></div> </div>
