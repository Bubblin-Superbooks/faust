<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
Would I were free from the thoughts  
That cross me, drawing hither and thither  
Despite me!

CHORUS

_Diesira, dies illa,_  
Solvet soeclum in favilla!  
_(Sound of the organ_.)  

EVIL SPIRIT

Wrath takes thee!  
The trumpet peals!  
The graves tremble!  
And thy heart  
From ashy rest </pre></div> </div>
