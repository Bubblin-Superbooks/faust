<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
To fiery torments  
Now again requickened,  
Throbs to life!

MARGARET

Would I were forth!  
I feel as if the organ here  
My breath takes from me,  
My very heart  
Dissolved by the anthem!

CHORUS

_Judex ergo cum sedebit,_  
Quidquid latet, ad parebit,  
Nil inultum remanebit. </pre></div> </div>
