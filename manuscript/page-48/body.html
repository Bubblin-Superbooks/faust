You meet by accident; you feel, you stay,<br>And by degrees your heart is tangled;<br>Bliss grows apace, and then its course is jangled;<br>You're ravished quite, then comes a touch of woe,<br>And there's a neat romance, completed ere you know!  
Let us, then, such a drama give!  
Grasp the exhaustless life that all men live!  
Each shares therein, though few may comprehend:<br>Where'er you touch, there's interest without end.<br>In motley pictures little light,<br>Much error, and of truth a glimmering mite,<br>Thus the best beverage is supplied,<br>Whence all the world is cheered and edified.<br>Then, at your play, behold the fairest flower<br>Of youth collect, to hear the revelation!  
Each tender</p></div> </div>
