MEPHISTOPHELES

Indeed? he'd like mankind to imitate!  
Now, in the Devil's name, go straight,  
Or I'll blow out his being's flickering spark!

WILL-O'-THE-WISP

You are the master of the house, I mark,  
And I shall try to serve you nicely.  
But then, reflect: the mountain's magic-mad to-day,  
And if a will-o'-the-wisp must guide you on the way,  
You mustn't take things too precisely.

FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES,</pre></div> </div>
