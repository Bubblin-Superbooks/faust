(_in alternating song_)

We, it seems, have entered newly  
In the sphere of dreams enchanted.  
Do thy bidding, guide us truly,  
That our feet be forwards planted  
In the vast, the desert spaces!  
See them swiftly changing places,  
Trees on trees beside us trooping,  
And the crags above us stooping,  
And the rocky snouts, outgrowing,â€”  
Hear them snoring, hear them blowing!  
O'er the stones, the grasses, flowing  
Stream and streamlet seek the hollow.  
Hear I noises? songs that follow?  
Hear I tender love-petitions? </pre></div> </div>
