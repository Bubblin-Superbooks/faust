Voices of those heavenly visions?  
Sounds of hope, of love undying!  
And the echoes, like traditions  
Of old days, come faint and hollow.  

Hoo-hoo! Shoo-hoo! Nearer hover  
Jay and screech-owl, and the plover,â€”  
Are they all awake and crying?  
Is't the salamander pushes,  
Bloated-bellied, through the bushes?  
And the roots, like serpents twisted,  
Through the sand and boulders toiling,  
Fright us, weirdest links uncoiling  
To entrap us, unresisted:  
Living knots and gnarls uncanny  
Feel with polypus-antennae  
For the wanderer. Mice are flying, </pre></div> </div>
