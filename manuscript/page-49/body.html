<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
Sways like a harp-string by the breezes fanned.  
I thrill and tremble; tear on tear is burning,  
And the stern heart is tenderly unmanned.  
What I possess, I see far distant lying,  
And what I lost, grows real and undying.  </code></pre><img width = "100%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/faust/master/assets/images/Illus-026.jpg" /></div> </div>
