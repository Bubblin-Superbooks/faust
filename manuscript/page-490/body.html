<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
Thousand-colored, herd-wise hieing  
Through the moss and through the heather!  

And the fire-flies wink and darkle,  
Crowded swarms that soar and sparkle,  
And in wildering escort gather!  

Tell me, if we still are standing,  
Or if further we're ascending?  
All is turning, whirling, blending,  
Trees and rocks with grinning faces,  
Wandering lights that spin in mazes,  
Still increasing and expanding!  

MEPHISTOPHELES

Grasp my skirt with heart undaunted! </pre></div> </div>
