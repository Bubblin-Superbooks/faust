MEPHISTOPHELES

Under the old ribs of the rock retreating,  
Hold fast, lest thou be hurled down the abysses there!  
The night with the mist is black;  
Hark! how the forests grind and crack!  
Frightened, the owlets are scattered:  
Hearken! the pillars are shattered.  
The evergreen palaces shaking!  
Boughs are groaning and breaking,  
The tree-trunks terribly thunder,  
The roots are twisting asunder!  
In frightfully intricate crashing  
Each on the other is dashing,  
And over the wreck-strewn gorges  
The tempest whistles and surges! </pre></div> </div>
