Hear'st thou voices higher ringing?  
Far away, or nearer singing?  
Yes, the mountain's side along,  
Sweeps an infuriate glamouring song!

WITCHES (_in chorus_)

The witches ride to the Brocken's top,  
The stubble is yellow, and green the crop.  
There gathers the crowd for carnival:  
Sir Urian sits over all.  

And so they go over stone and stock;  
The witch she——-s, and——-s the buck.  

A VOICE </pre></div> </div>
