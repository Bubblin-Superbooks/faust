WITCHES (_chorus_)

The way is wide, the way is long:  
See, what a wild and crazy throng!  
The broom it scratches, the fork it thrusts,  
The child is stifled, the mother bursts.  

WIZARDS (_semichorus_)

As doth the snail in shell, we crawl:  
Before us go the women all.  
When towards the Devil's House we tread,  
Woman's a thousand steps ahead.
