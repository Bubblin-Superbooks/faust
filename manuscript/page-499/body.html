We do not measure with such care:  
Woman in thousand steps is theft.  
But howsoe'er she hasten may,  
Man in one leap has cleared the way.  

VOICE (_from above_)

Come on, come on, from Rocky Lake!

VOICE (_from below_)

Aloft we'd fain ourselves betake.  
We've washed, and are bright as ever you will,  
Yet we're eternally sterile still.
