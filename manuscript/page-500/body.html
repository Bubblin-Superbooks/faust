The wind is hushed, the star shoots by.  
The dreary moon forsakes the sky;  
The magic notes, like spark on spark,  
Drizzle, whistling through the dark.  

VOICE (_from below_)

Halt, there! Ho, there!

VOICE (_from above_)

Who calls from the rocky cleft below there?

VOICE (_below_)

Take me, too! take me, too! </pre></div> </div>
