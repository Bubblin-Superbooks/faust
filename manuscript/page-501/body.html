<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
I'm climbing now three hundred years,  
And yet the summit cannot see:  
Among my equals I would be.

BOTH CHORUSES

Bears the broom and bears the stock,  
Bears the fork and bears the buck:  
Who cannot raise himself to-night  
Is evermore a ruined wight.  

HALF-WITCH (_below_)

So long I stumble, ill bestead,  
And the others are now so far ahead!  
At home I've neither rest nor cheer,  
And yet I cannot gain them</pre></div> </div>
