MEPHISTOPHELES

They crowd and push, they roar and clatter!  
They whirl and whistle, pull and chatter!  
They shine, and spirt, and stink, and burn!  
The true witch-element we learn.  
Keep close! or we are parted, in our turn,  
Where art thou?

FAUST (_in the distance_)

Here!

MEPHISTOPHELES

What! whirled so far astray? </pre></div> </div>
