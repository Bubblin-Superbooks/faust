Then house-right I must use, and clear the way.  
Make room! Squire Voland comes! Room, gentle rabble,  
room!  

Here, Doctor, hold to me: in one jump we'll resume

Yonder, with special light, there's something shining clearer  
Within those bushes; I've a mind to see.  
Come on! we'll slip a little nearer.
