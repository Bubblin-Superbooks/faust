MEPHISTOPHELES

But there enigmas also knotted be.  
Leave to the multitude their riot!  
Here will we house ourselves in quiet.  
It is an old, transmitted trade,  
That in the greater world the little worlds are made.  
I see stark-nude young witches congregate,  
And old ones, veiled and hidden shrewdly:  
On my account be kind, nor treat them rudely!  
The trouble's small, the fun is great.  
I hear the noise of instruments attuning,â€”  
Vile din! yet one must learn to bear the crooning.  
Come, come along! It _must_ be, I declare!  
I'll go ahead and introduce thee there,  
Thine obligation newly earning. </pre></div> </div>
