But honored and at home is here the cloven foot.  
Perceiv'st thou yonder snail? It cometh, slow and steady;  
So delicately its feelers pry,  
That it hath scented me already:  
I cannot here disguise me, if I try.  
But come! we'll go from this fire to a newer:  
I am the go-between, and thou the wooer.

(_To some, who are sitting around dying embers_:)

Old gentlemen, why at the outskirts? Enter!  
I'd praise you if I found you snugly in the centre,  
With youth and revel round you like a zone:  
You each, at home, are quite enough</pre></div> </div>
