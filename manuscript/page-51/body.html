You two, who oft a helping hand  
Have lent, in need and tribulation.  
Come, let me know your expectation  
Of this, our enterprise, in German land!  
I wish the crowd to feel itself well treated,  
Especially since it lives and lets me live;  
The posts are set, the booth of boards completed.  
And each awaits the banquet I shall give.  
Already there, with curious eyebrows raised,  
They sit sedate, and hope to be amazed.  
I know how one the People's taste may flatter,  
Yet here a huge embarrassment I feel:  
What they're accustomed to, is no great matter, </pre></div> </div>
