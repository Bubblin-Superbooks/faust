FAUST (_dancing_)

O, everywhere on him you fall!  
When others dance, he weighs the matter:  
If he can't every step bechatter,  
Then 'tis the same as were the step not made;  
But if you forwards go, his ire is most displayed.  
If you would whirl in regular gyration  
As he does in his dull old mill,  
He'd show, at any rate, good-will,â€”  
Especially if you heard and heeded his hortation.

PROKTOPHANTASMIST

You still are here? Nay, 'tis a thing unheard!  
Vanish, at once! We've said the enlightening word. </pre></div> </div>
