But then, alas! they've read an awful deal.  
How shall we plan, that all be fresh and new,â€”  
Important matter, yet attractive too?  
For 'tis my pleasure-to behold them surging,  
When to our booth the current sets apace,  
And with tremendous, oft-repeated urging,  
Squeeze onward through the narrow gate of grace:  
By daylight even, they push and cram in  
To reach the seller's box, a fighting host,  
And as for bread, around a baker's door, in famine,  
To get a ticket break their necks almost.  
This miracle alone can work the Poet  
On men so various: now, my friend, pray show it.
