MEPHISTOPHELES

Tis magic all, thou fool, seduced so easily!  
Unto each man his love she seems to be.

FAUST

The woe, the rapture, so ensnare me,  
That from her gaze I cannot tear me!  
And, strange! around her fairest throat  
A single scarlet band is gleaming,  
No broader than a knife-blade seeming!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Quite right! The mark I also note. </pre></div> </div>
