Whom but to see, puts out the fire of Song!  
Hide from my view the surging crowd that passes,  
And in its whirlpool forces us along!  
No, lead me where some heavenly silence glasses  
The purer joys that round the Poet throng,—  
Where Love and Friendship still divinely fashion  
The bonds that bless, the wreaths that crown his passion!  
Ah, every utterance from the depths of feeling  
The timid lips have stammeringly expressed,—  
Now failing, now, perchance, success revealing,—  
Gulps the wild Moment in its greedy breast;  
Or oft, reluctant years its warrant sealing,  
Its perfect stature stands at last confessed!  
What dazzles, for the Moment spends its spirit:  
What's genuine, shall Posterity inherit. </pre></div> </div>
