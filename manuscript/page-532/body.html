SOLO

See the bagpipe on our track!  
'Tis the soap-blown bubble:  
Hear the _schnecke-schnicke-schnack_  
Through his nostrils double!

SPIRIT, JUST GROWING INTO FORM

Spider's foot and paunch of toad,  
And little wingsâ€”we know 'em!  
A little creature 'twill not be,  
But yet, a little poem.

A LITTLE</pre></div> </div>
