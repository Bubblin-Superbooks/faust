Fly-snout and mosquito-bill,  
Don't swarm so round the Naked!  
Frog in grass and cricket-trill,  
Observe the time, and make it!

WEATHERCOCK (_towards one side_)

Society to one's desire!  
Brides only, and the sweetest!  
And bachelors of youth and fire.  
And prospects the completest!

WEATHERCOCK (_towards the other side_)

And if the Earth don't open now  
To swallow up each ranter, </pre></div> </div>
