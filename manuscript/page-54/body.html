MERRY-ANDREW  

Posterity! Don't name the word to me!  
If _I_ should choose to preach Posterity,  
Where would you get contemporary fun?  
That men _will_ have it, there's no blinking:  
A fine young fellow's presence, to my thinking,  
Is something worth, to every one.  
Who genially his nature can outpour,  
Takes from the People's moods no irritation;  
The wider circle he acquires, the more  
Securely works his inspiration.  
Then pluck up heart, and give us sterling coin!  
Let Fancy be with her attendants fitted,—  
Sense, Reason, Sentiment, and Passion join,—  
But have a care, lest Folly be omitted! </pre></div> </div>
