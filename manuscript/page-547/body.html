ARIEL

If loving Nature at your back,  
Or Mind, the wings uncloses,  
Follow up my airy track  
To the mount of roses!

ORCHESTRA

_pianissimo_  
Cloud and trailing mist o'erhead  
Are now illuminated:  
Air in leaves, and wind in reed,  
And all is dissipated.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
