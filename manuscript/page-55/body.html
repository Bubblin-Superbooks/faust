MANAGER

Chiefly, enough of incident prepare!  
They come to look, and they prefer to stare.  
Reel off a host of threads before their faces,  
So that they gape in stupid wonder: then  
By sheer diffuseness you have won their graces,  
And are, at once, most popular of men.  
Only by mass you touch the mass; for any  
Will finally, himself, his bit select:  
Who offers much, brings something unto many,  
And each goes home content with the effect,  
If you've a piece, why, just in pieces give it:  
A hash, a stew, will bring success, believe it!  
'Tis easily displayed, and easy to invent.  
What use, a Whole compactly to present? </pre></div> </div>
