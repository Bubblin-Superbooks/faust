FAUST

(_with a bunch of keys and a lamp, before an iron door_)

A shudder, long unfelt, comes o'er me;  
Mankind's collected woe o'erwhelms me, here.  
She dwells within the dark, damp walls before me,  
And all her crime was a delusion dear!  
What! I delay to free her?  
I dread, once again to see her?  
On! my shrinking but lingers Death more near.
