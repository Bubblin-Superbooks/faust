FAUST

Shall I outlive this misery?

MARGARET

Now am I wholly in thy might.  
But let me suckle, first, my baby!  
I blissed it all this livelong night;  
They took 't away, to vex me, maybe,  
And now they say I killed the child outright.  
And never shall I be glad again.  
They sing songs about me! 'tis bad of the folk to do it!  
There's an old story has the same refrain;  
Who bade them so construe</pre></div> </div>
