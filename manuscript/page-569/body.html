FAUST (_aloud_)

Margaret! Margaret!

MARGARET (_attentively listening_)

That was the voice of my lover!

(_She springs to her feet: the fetters fall off_.)

Where is he? I heard him call me.

On his bosom lie!  
On the threshold he stood, and _Margaret_! calling,  
Midst of Hell's howling and noises appalling, </pre></div> </div>
