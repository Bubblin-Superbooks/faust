Another, satiate, leaves the banquet's tapers,  
And, worst of all, full many a wight  
Is fresh from reading of the daily papers.  
Idly to us they come, as to a masquerade,  
Mere curiosity their spirits warming:  
The ladies with themselves, and with their finery, aid,  
Without a salary their parts performing.  
What dreams are yours in high poetic places?  
You're pleased, forsooth, full houses to behold?  
Draw near, and view your patrons' faces!  
The half are coarse, the half are cold.  
One, when the play is out, goes home to cards;  
A wild night on a wench's breast another chooses:  
Why should you rack, poor, foolish bards,  
For ends like these, the gracious Muses?  
I tell you, give but moreâ€”more, ever more, they ask:  
Thus shall you hit the mark of gain and glory. </pre></div> </div>
