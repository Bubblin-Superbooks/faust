FAUST

Away, now!  
If longer here thou stayest,  
We shall be made to dearly rue it.

MARGARET

Kiss me!—canst no longer do it?  
My friend, so short a time thou'rt missing,  
And hast unlearned thy kissing?  
Why is my heart so anxious, on thy breast?  
Where once a heaven thy glances did create me,  
A heaven thy loving words expressed,  
And thou didst kiss, as thou wouldst suffocate me—  
Kiss me! </pre></div> </div>
