FAUST

Come! come! The night already vanisheth.

MARGARET

My mother have I put to death;  
I've drowned the baby born to thee.  
Was it not given to thee and me?  
Thee, too!—'Tis thou! It scarcely true doth seem—  
Give me thy hand! 'Tis not a dream!  
Thy dear, dear hand!—But, ah, 'tis wet!  
Why, wipe it off! Methinks that yet  
There's blood thereon.  
Ah, God! what hast thou done?  
Nay, sheathe thy sword at last! </pre></div> </div>
