Do not affray me!

FAUST

O, let the past be past!  
Thy words will slay me!

MARGARET

No, no! Thou must outlive us.  
Now I'll tell thee the graves to give us:  
Thou must begin to-morrow  
The work of sorrow!  
The best place give to my mother,  
Then close at her side my brother,  
And me a little away,  
But not too very far, I pray! </pre></div> </div>
