<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
And here, on my right breast, my baby lay!  
Nobody else will lie beside me!â€”  
Ah, within thine arms to hide me,  
That was a sweet and a gracious bliss,  
But no more, no more can I attain it!  
I would force myself on thee and constrain it,  
And it seems thou repellest my kiss:  
And yet 'tis thou, so good, so kind to see!

FAUST

If thou feel'st it is I, then come with me!
