MARGARET

I dare not go: there's no hope any more.  
Why should I fly? They'll still my steps waylay!  
It is so wretched, forced to beg my living,  
And a bad conscience sharper misery giving!  
It is so wretched, to be strange, forsaken,  
And I'd still be followed and taken!

FAUST

I'll stay with thee.

MARGARET

Be quick! Be quick! </pre></div> </div>
