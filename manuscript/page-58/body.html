Seek to confound your auditory!  
To satisfy them is a task.â€”  
What ails you now? Is't suffering, or pleasure?  

POET

Go, find yourself a more obedient slave!  
What! shall the Poet that which Nature gave,  
The highest right, supreme Humanity,  
Forfeit so wantonly, to swell your treasure?  
Whence o'er the heart his empire free?  
The elements of Life how conquers he?  
Is't not his heart's accord, urged outward far and dim,  
To wind the world in unison with him?  
When on the spindle, spun to endless distance,  
By Nature's listless hand the thread is twirled,  
And the discordant tones of all existence </pre></div> </div>
