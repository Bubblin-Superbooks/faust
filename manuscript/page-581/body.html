<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>If The Grave Is There, Death Lying In Wait, Then Come!</h3><pre class="  "><code>Over the bridge,  
Into the wood,  
To the left, where the plank is placed  
In the pool!  
Seize it in haste!  
'Tis trying to rise,  
'Tis struggling still!  
Save it! Save it!

FAUST

Recall thy wandering will! </pre></div> </div>
