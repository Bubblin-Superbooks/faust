One step, and thou art free at last!

MARGARET

If the mountain we had only passed!  
There sits my mother upon a stone,â€”  
I feel an icy shiver!  
There sits my mother upon a stone,  
And her head is wagging ever.  
She beckons, she nods not, her heavy head falls o'er;  
She slept so long that she wakes no more.  
She slept, while we were caressing:  
Ah, those were the days of blessing!
