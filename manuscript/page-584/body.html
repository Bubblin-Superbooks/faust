Woe for my garland! The chances  
Are over—'tis all in vain!  
We shall meet once again,  
But not at the dances!  
The crowd is thronging, no word is spoken:  
The square below  
And the streets overflow:  
The death-bell tolls, the wand is broken.  
I am seized, and bound, and delivered—  
Shoved to the block—they give the sign!  
Now over each neck has quivered  
The blade that is quivering over mine.  
Dumb lies the world like the grave!

FAUST
