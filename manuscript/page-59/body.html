In sullen jangle are together hurled,  
Who, then, the changeless orders of creation  
Divides, and kindles into rhythmic dance?  
Who brings the One to join the general ordination,  
Where it may throb in grandest consonance?  
Who bids the storm to passion stir the bosom?  
In brooding souls the sunset burn above?  
Who scatters every fairest April blossom  
Along the shining path of Love?  
Who braids the noteless leaves to crowns, requiting  
Desert with fame, in Action's every field?  
Who makes Olympus sure, the Gods uniting?  
The might of Man, as in the Bard revealed.

MERRY-ANDREW  

So, these fine forces, in conjunction, </pre></div> </div>
