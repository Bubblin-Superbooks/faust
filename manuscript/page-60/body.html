Propel the high poetic function,  
As in a love-adventure they might play!  
You meet by accident; you feel, you stay,  
And by degrees your heart is tangled;  
Bliss grows apace, and then its course is jangled;  
You're ravished quite, then comes a touch of woe,  
And there's a neat romance, completed ere you know!  
Let us, then, such a drama give!  
Grasp the exhaustless life that all men live!  
Each shares therein, though few may comprehend:  
Where'er you touch, there's interest without end.  
In motley pictures little light,  
Much error, and of truth a glimmering mite,  
Thus the best beverage is supplied,  
Whence all the world is cheered and edified.  
Then, at your play, behold the fairest flower  
Of youth collect, to hear the revelation! </pre></div> </div>
