When, after dancing out your breath,  
You pass the night in dissipating:—  
But that familiar harp with soul  
To play,—with grace and bold expression,  
And towards a self-erected goal  
To walk with many a sweet digression,—  
This, aged Sirs, belongs to you,  
And we no less revere you for that reason:  
Age childish makes, they say, but 'tis not true;  
We're only genuine children still, in Age's season! 

MANAGER  

The words you've bandied are sufficient;  
'Tis deeds that I prefer to see:  
In compliments you're both proficient,  
But might, the while, more useful be. </pre></div> </div>
