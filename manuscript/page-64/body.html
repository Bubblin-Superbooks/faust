What need to talk of Inspiration?  
'Tis no companion of Delay.  
If Poetry be your vocation,  
Let Poetry your will obey!  
Full well you know what here is wanting;  
The crowd for strongest drink is panting,  
And such, forthwith, I'd have you brew.  
What's left undone to-day, To-morrow will not do.  
Waste not a day in vain digression:  
With resolute, courageous trust  
Seize every possible impression,  
And make it firmly your possession;  
You'll then work on, because you must.  
Upon our German stage, you know it,  
Each tries his hand at what he will;  
So, take of traps and scenes your fill,  
And all you find, be sure to show it! </pre></div> </div>
