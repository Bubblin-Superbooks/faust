Use both the great and lesser heavenly light,â€”  
Squander the stars in any number,  
Beasts, birds, trees, rocks, and all such lumber,  
Fire, water, darkness, Day and Night!  
Thus, in our booth's contracted sphere,  
The circle of Creation will appear,  
And move, as we deliberately impel,  
From Heaven, across the World, to Hell! </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
