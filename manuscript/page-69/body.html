The lofty works, uncomprehended,  
Are bright as on the earliest day.  

GABRIEL  

And swift, and swift beyond conceiving,  
The splendor of the world goes round,  
Day's Eden-brightness still relieving  
The awful Night's intense profound:  
The ocean-tides in foam are breaking,  
Against the rocks' deep bases hurled,  
And both, the spheric race partaking,  
Eternal, swift, are onward whirled!  

MICHAEL  

And rival storms abroad are surging </pre></div> </div>
