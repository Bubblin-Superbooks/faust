From sea to land, from land to sea.  
A chain of deepest action forging  
Round all, in wrathful energy.  
There flames a desolation, blazing  
Before the Thunder's crashing way:  
Yet, Lord, Thy messengers are praising  
The gentle movement of Thy Day.  

THE THREE  

Though still by them uncomprehended,  
From these the angels draw their power,  
And all Thy works, sublime and splendid,  
Are bright as in Creation's hour.
