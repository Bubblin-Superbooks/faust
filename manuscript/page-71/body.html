Since Thou, O Lord, deign'st to approach again  
And ask us how we do, in manner kindest,  
And heretofore to meet myself wert fain,  
Among Thy menials, now, my face Thou findest.  
Pardon, this troop I cannot follow after  
With lofty speech, though by them scorned and spurned:  
My pathos certainly would move Thy laughter,  
If Thou hadst not all merriment unlearned.  
Of suns and worlds I've nothing to be quoted;  
How men torment themselves, is all I've noted.  
The little god o' the world sticks to the same old way,  
And is as whimsical as on Creation's day.  
Life somewhat better might content him,  
But for the gleam of heavenly light which Thou hast lent </pre></div> </div>
