Thou, Spirit of the Earth, art nearer:<br>Even now my powers are loftier, clearer;<br>I glow, as drunk with new-made wine:<br>New strength and heart to meet the world incite me,<br>The woe of earth, the bliss of earth, invite me,<br>And though the shock of storms may smite me,<br>No crash of shipwreck shall have power to fright me!  
Clouds gather over me—<br>The moon conceals her light—<br>The lamp's extinguished!—<br>Mists rise,—red, angry rays are darting<br>Around my head!—There falls<br>A horror from the vaulted roof,<br>And seizes me!  
I feel thy presence, Spirit I invoke! </p></div> </div>
