He calls it Reasonâ€”thence his power's increased,  
To be far beastlier than any beast.  
Saving Thy Gracious Presence, he to me  
A long-legged grasshopper appears to be,  
That springing flies, and flying springs,  
And in the grass the same old ditty sings.  
Would he still lay among the grass he grows in!  
Each bit of dung he seeks, to stick his nose in.  

THE LORD  

Hast thou, then, nothing more to mention?  
Com'st ever, thus, with ill intention?  
Find'st nothing right on earth, eternally?
