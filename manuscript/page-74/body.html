MEPHISTOPHELES  

Forsooth! He serves you after strange devices:  
No earthly meat or drink the fool suffices:  
His spirit's ferment far aspireth;  
Half conscious of his frenzied, crazed unrest,  
The fairest stars from Heaven he requireth,  
From Earth the highest raptures and the best,  
And all the Near and Far that he desireth  
Fails to subdue the tumult of his breast.  

THE LORD  

Though still confused his service unto Me,  
I soon shall lead him to a clearer morning.  
Sees not the gardener, even while buds his tree, </pre></div> </div>
