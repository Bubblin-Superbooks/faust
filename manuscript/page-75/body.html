MEPHISTOPHELES  

What will you bet? There's still a chance to gain him,  
If unto me full leave you give,  
Gently upon _my_ road to train him!  

THE LORD  

As long as he on earth shall live,  
So long I make no prohibition.  
While Man's desires and aspirations stir,  
He cannot choose but err.
