My thanks! I find the dead no acquisition,  
And never cared to have them in my keeping.  
I much prefer the cheeks where ruddy blood is leaping,  
And when a corpse approaches, close my house:  
It goes with me, as with the cat the mouse.  

THE LORD  

Enough! What thou hast asked is granted.  
Turn off this spirit from his fountain-head;  
To trap him, let thy snares be planted,  
And him, with thee, be downward led;  
Then stand abashed, when thou art forced to say:  
A good man, through obscurest aspiration,  
Has still an instinct of the one true way. </pre></div> </div>
