Unqualified repose he learns to crave;  
Whence, willingly, the comrade him I gave,  
Who works, excites, and must create, as Devil.  
But ye, God's sons in love and duty,  
Enjoy the rich, the ever-living Beauty!  
Creative Power, that works eternal schemes,  
Clasp you in bonds of love, relaxing never,  
And what in wavering apparition gleams  
Fix in its place with thoughts that stand forever!

I like, at times, to hear The Ancient's word,  
And have a care to be most civil:  
It's really kind of such a noble Lord </pre></div> </div>
