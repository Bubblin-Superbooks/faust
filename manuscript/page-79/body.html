<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">granted<br>When, in the spirit of the ages planted,<br>We mark how, ere our times, a sage has thought,<br>And then, how far his work, and grandly, we have brought.</p><p>FAUST</p><p>O yes, up to the stars at last!  
Listen, my friend: the ages that are past<br>Are now a book with seven seals protected:<br>What you the Spirit of the Ages call<br>Is nothing but the spirit of you all,<br>Wherein the Ages are reflected.<br>So, oftentimes, you miserably mar it!  
At the first glance who sees it runs away.<br>An offal-barrel and a lumber-garret,<br>Or, at the best, a Punch-and-Judy play,<br>With maxims most pragmatical and hitting,<br>As in the mouths of puppets are befitting!</p></div> </div>
