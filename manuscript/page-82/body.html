I'm Magister—yea, Doctor—hight,  
And straight or cross-wise, wrong or right,  
These ten years long, with many woes,  
I've led my scholars by the nose,—  
And see, that nothing can be known!  
_That_ knowledge cuts me to the bone.  
I'm cleverer, true, than those fops of teachers,  
Doctors and Magisters, Scribes and Preachers;  
Neither scruples nor doubts come now to smite me,  
Nor Hell nor Devil can longer affright me.  

For this, all pleasure am I foregoing;  
I do not pretend to aught worth knowing,  
I do not pretend I could be a teacher  
To help or convert a fellow-creature.  
Then, too, I've neither lands nor gold,  
Nor the world's least pomp or honor hold— </pre></div> </div>
