No dog would endure such a curst existence!  
Wherefore, from Magic I seek assistance,  
That many a secret perchance I reach  
Through spirit-power and spirit-speech,  
And thus the bitter task forego  
Of saying the things I do not know,—  
That I may detect the inmost force  
Which binds the world, and guides its course;  
Its germs, productive powers explore,  
And rummage in empty words no more!

Have, from this desk, seen climb the sky  
So many a midnight,—would thy glow  
For the last time beheld my woe!  
Ever thine eye, most mournful friend,  
O'er books and papers saw me bend; </pre></div> </div>
