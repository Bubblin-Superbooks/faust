But would that I, on mountains grand,  
Amid thy blessed light could stand,  
With spirits through mountain-caverns hover,  
Float in thy twilight the meadows over,  
And, freed from the fumes of lore that swathe me,  
To health in thy dewy fountains bathe me!  

Ah, me! this dungeon still I see.  
This drear, accursed masonry,  
Where even the welcome daylight strains  
But duskly through the painted panes.  
Hemmed in by many a toppling heap  
Of books worm-eaten, gray with dust,  
Which to the vaulted ceiling creep,  
Against the smoky paper thrust,â€”  
With glasses, boxes, round me stacked,  
And instruments together hurled, </pre></div> </div>
