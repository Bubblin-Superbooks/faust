Ancestral lumber, stuffed and packedâ€”  
Such is my world: and what a world!  

And do I ask, wherefore my heart  
Falters, oppressed with unknown needs?  
Why some inexplicable smart  
All movement of my life impedes?  
Alas! in living Nature's stead,  
Where God His human creature set,  
In smoke and mould the fleshless dead  
And bones of beasts surround me yet!  

Fly! Up, and seek the broad, free land!  
And this one Book of Mystery  
From Nostradamus' very hand,  
Is't not sufficient company?  
When I the starry courses know, </pre></div> </div>
