<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
My troubled heart to joy unsealing,  
With impulse, mystic and divine,  
The powers of Nature here, around my path, revealing?  
Am I a God?â€”so clear mine eyes!  
In these pure features I behold  
Creative Nature to my soul unfold.  
What says the sage, now first I recognize:  
"The spirit-world no closures fasten;  
Thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead:  
Disciple, up! untiring, hasten  
To bathe thy breast in morning-red!"  

(_He contemplates the sign_.)  

How each the Whole its substance gives,  
Each in the other works and lives! </pre></div> </div>
