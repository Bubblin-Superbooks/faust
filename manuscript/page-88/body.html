Like heavenly forces rising and descending,  
Their golden urns reciprocally lending,  
With wings that winnow blessing  
From Heaven through Earth I see them pressing,  
Filling the All with harmony unceasing!  
How grand a show! but, ah! a show alone.  
Thee, boundless Nature, how make thee my own?  
Where you, ye beasts? Founts of all Being, shining,  
Whereon hang Heaven's and Earth's desire,  
Whereto our withered hearts aspire,â€”  
Ye flow, ye feed: and am I vainly pining?  

(_He turns the leaves impatiently, and perceives the sign of the  
Earth-Spirit_.)  

How otherwise upon me works this sign! </pre></div> </div>
