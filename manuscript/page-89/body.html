Thou, Spirit of the Earth, art nearer:  
Even now my powers are loftier, clearer;  
I glow, as drunk with new-made wine:  
New strength and heart to meet the world incite me,  
The woe of earth, the bliss of earth, invite me,  
And though the shock of storms may smite me,  
No crash of shipwreck shall have power to fright me!  
Clouds gather over me—  
The moon conceals her light—  
The lamp's extinguished!—  
Mists rise,—red, angry rays are darting  
Around my head!—There falls  
A horror from the vaulted roof,  
And seizes me!  
I feel thy presence, Spirit I invoke!  
Reveal thyself!  
Ha! in my heart what rending stroke! </pre></div> </div>
