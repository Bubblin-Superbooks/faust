Thee, superhuman, shakes? Thy soul's high calling, where?  
Where is the breast, which from itself a world did bear,  
And shaped and cherishedâ€”which with joy expanded,  
To be our peer, with us, the Spirits, banded?  
Where art thou, Faust, whose voice has pierced to me,  
Who towards me pressed with all thine energy?  
_He_ art thou, who, my presence breathing, seeing,  
Trembles through all the depths of being,  
A writhing worm, a terror-stricken form?  

FAUST  

Thee, form of flame, shall I then fear?  
Yes, I am Faust: I am thy peer!
