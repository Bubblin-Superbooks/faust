In the tides of Life, in Action's storm,  
A fluctuant wave,  
A shuttle free,  
Birth and the Grave,  
An eternal sea,  
A weaving, flowing  
Life, all-glowing,  
Thus at Time's humming loom 'tis my hand prepares  
The garment of Life which the Deity wears! 

FAUST  

Thou, who around the wide world wendest,  
Thou busy Spirit, how near I feel to thee!
