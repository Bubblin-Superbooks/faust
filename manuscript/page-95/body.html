In all the fullness of my vision  
The soulless sneak disturbs me thus!  

(_Enter_ WAGNER_, in dressing-gown and night-cap, a lamp in  
his hand._ FAUST _turns impatiently_.)  

WAGNER  

Pardon, I heard your declamation;  
'Twas sure an old Greek tragedy you read?  
In such an art I crave some preparation,  
Since now it stands one in good stead.  
I've often heard it said, a preacher  
Might learn, with a comedian for a teacher.
