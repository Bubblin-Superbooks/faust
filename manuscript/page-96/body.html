Yes, when the priest comedian is by nature,  
As haply now and then the case may be.  

WAGNER  

Ah, when one studies thus, a prisoned creature,  
That scarce the world on holidays can see,â€”  
Scarce through a glass, by rare occasion,  
How shall one lead it by persuasion?

Save from the soul it rises clear,  
Serene in primal strength, compelling  
The hearts and minds of all who hear. </pre></div> </div>
