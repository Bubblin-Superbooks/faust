You sit forever gluing, patching;  
You cook the scraps from others' fare;  
And from your heap of ashes hatching  
A starveling flame, ye blow it bare!  
Take children's, monkeys' gaze admiring,  
If such your taste, and be content;  
But ne'er from heart to heart you'll speak inspiring,  
Save your own heart is eloquent! 

WAGNER  

Yet through delivery orators succeed;  
I feel that I am far behind, indeed.  

FAUST  

Seek thou the honest recompense! </pre></div> </div>
