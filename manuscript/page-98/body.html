Beware, a tinkling fool to be!  
With little art, clear wit and sense  
Suggest their own delivery;  
And if thou'rt moved to speak in earnest,  
What need, that after words thou yearnest?  
Yes, your discourses, with their glittering show,  
Where ye for men twist shredded thought like paper,  
Are unrefreshing as the winds that blow  
The rustling leaves through chill autumnal vapor!  

WAGNER  

Ah, God! but Art is long,  
And Life, alas! is fleeting.  
And oft, with zeal my critic-duties meeting,  
In head and breast there's something wrong. </pre></div> </div>
